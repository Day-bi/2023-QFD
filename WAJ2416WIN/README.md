# Abstract
1. Prior QFD studies were qualitative and expert-driven, often overlooking quantitative analysis of engineering characteristics (EC).

2. This study introduces a data-driven framework that extracts and quantifies customer requirements (CR) from reviews and EC from manuals.

3. The CR-EC relationships are visualized using co-occurrence analysis and Importanceâ€“Performance Analysis (IPA), offering practical insights for data-informed product development.
