# Abstract
1. Prior QFD studies were qualitative and expert-driven, often overlooking quantitative analysis of engineering characteristics (EC).

2. This study introduces a data-driven framework that extracts and quantifies customer requirements (CR) from reviews and EC from manuals.

3. The CR-EC links are visualized through co-occurrence and IPA, supporting data-informed product decisions.
