5,2022-12-16,5,The best washing machine ever !!!!,"I have heard people saying , washing machine is not that usefull for too dirty clothes  and clothes won't get cleaned properly but after using this washing machine I felt this is just a misconception.Clothes are getting super clean.

7,2016-10-12,2,Dont even think about it !,"Amazon delivered the product in one day flat ! But thats where all the the good experiences ended. What followed was a harrowing ordeal with the service agents to get installation done.We called up customer service to schedule installation/demo. The guy told us we'd have to wait for 48 hours. He didnt give us any SR number either. Next day we got a call from the local (Kolkata) servicing agents who asked us to ""confirm"" a lot of things before he could schedule the installation/demo. This included installation of a 15 Ampere power point socket next to the machine, pre-installed water inlet with 3/4 or 1/2 inch stop cock and water outlet with complete plumbing done amongst other things. Then he went on rambling about selling us accessories, extended warranty and 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch converters for 200 bucks. Since we were already using a Samsung automatic at the same spot prior to purchasing the Bosch, we figured everything was in order except the size of the stop cock outlet which we werent sure of. We checked it and found it had a 1/2 inch outlet. We got a plumber to install a 3/4 inch stopcock since we could get a 3/4 inch stopcock for less than the amount being charged for converter. We called back at the landline number to confirm. The guy (Mr Biswas) instead of confirming the installation call, kept on harping about accessories (machine cover, desilicating powder and what not) which we should be ordering (so that the installation guy could carry them with him). We said we didnt need anything. After a lot of argument, he finally scheduled a call. Next day a thin guy appeared for installation/demo. Almost as if we were expected to unpack and move the one tonne machine ourselves which is what we had done anyways. He quickly checked a few things and said the machine couldnt be installed. When we asked him the reason, he simply said the stopcock outlet measurement didnt match with the water supply hose provided by the company. We checked the hose and sure enough it didnt match. But that was because it was 1 inch in diameter. We told him we had got the plumbing done as per his requirement only. Instead of accepting that wrong specifications were provided or looking for alternate solutions (getting us to purchase a 3/4 inch to 1 inch converter from nearby shop), he refused to even accept the measurements. Like a madman he kept on insisting that our stopcock was 1/2 inch and the supply hose was 3/4 inches. By this time we were thoroughly irritated so we asked him to just open the transport locks and leave it at that so that we could install the machine ourselves. He said if he did that, the installation would be deemed complete and he would not come back again. We knew we had made a blunder. If this is what was happening during installation, God knows what will happen when there'll be a bigger problem down the line. For our part, we refused to sign the service sheet so that he couldnt claim the installation cost from the company. What we learnt the hard way :-(1) There is no such thing as ""installation"". The service agents extort a lot of money from the company in the name of installation but the entire expense and the headache lies completely with the customer. The service agent will come just to push the start button and claim installation money from the company.(2) Even if customer is okay with bearing all the plumbing expenses, the agents will mislead them about the specifications of the stopcock, etc so that they can sell converters at obnoxious prices.(3) The agents/company have a distinctly hands-offish approach to handling their customers. They wont provide SR numbers. They wont provide mobile numbers. They wont provide visiting cards. You cant even register/check your warranty online. So that if any problem arises (eg., there is a service audit or someone files a suit), they can deny everything and claim ""no accountability"".(4) The screws/bolts are all proprietary and its next to impossible for the user to unfasten them without specialised equipment.(5) The instruction manual provided with the machine is complete zilch. It is not even model specific, forget about carrying basic details such as power requirements, clearance requirements for installation, program load/timing variations, etc. Pathetic and simply not expected from a company like Bosch !But as they say in this country, you can get away with anything :-("
8,2016-05-29,5,Good product but horrible customer service.,"Wonderful product. Has everything and even more than what i needed. But the customer service is very poor. It took too weeks to run the machine.When i dialed their toll free number on the first day, they took the purchase details and my address and told me that a representative will be sent after 48 hours.When i called on the 3rd day, the executive asked me whether the machine is fitted completely. When i said no, he told right away that he would come only after the machine is fitted completely and only to show the Demo. I was angry but didn't show it outside and just replied, 'i will call you after fitting the machine sir'. Seriously, what do they think of us, are we so dumb to not even know how to use the machine. What is the use of customer service when they don't come to fit the machine?I went through the manual completely and found that the machine should be leveled using spirit level and the machine requires proper pressure. How am i supposed to do that myself without any of those devices in my home. When i called the customer care they asked me to ignore those instructions and fit the machine. Irritated to the core, i assembled the machine as instructed in the manual. Replaced the tap with a new universal water tap sold for specially for washing machines. When i connected the hose to the tap it slipped without sitting tightly with the tap. There was heavy water leakage. Got a plumber next day and he asked me to replace the hose with a third party hose. He said that the hose is too small and doesn't fit with the tap properly. Didn't understand whether it was tap's fault or the hose's fault, just followed what the plumber said.Felt happy that the assembly was complete and when i tried to plugin the machine, the pin was way too big and didn't fit inside the socket. Confused what size of socket or how many amps it requires, i called the customer care again. This time he said he was free and will come to my home if the machine is assembled and that he is available only for today. Still i didn't raise my voice and just told my situation. He asked me to buy a 16 Amps socket to fit the machine.I bought the socket and that too was so big. I couldn't replace it with the small socket in my switch board and had to cut the switchboard with hacksaw blade all by myself and fit the socket. All set and done. Switched on the machine. Selected the Drum clean program as the manual instructed me to do before the first use. Went well suddenly an error appeared ""E:17"". I was damned, palm on my face.Again called the customer care and he told that there is some pressure problem and asked me not to do anything until the executive arrives.They sent a technician next day and he refitted the hose and tap with extra accessories which came along with the hose. The device worked perfectly.I was not happy at all. I raged on that person to change the way they serve the customers. My concern is, i could go through the manual fit the machine but what about the illiterate people who buy the machine. How are they supposed to read the manual which is in English and fit the machine.If the machine is assembled without proper leveling and encounters any repair, then the warranty is void. Either they should inform what are the accessories required and how the machine should be installed in Indian conditions or they should do all the work by themselves. I'm not some electrician or plumber to do the work all by myself.I'm sure they won't change citing their time constraints of their representatives so, customers we have to ask about their customer service beforehand. My kind advice is, whatever be the brand of washing machine you buy, ask the customer care to give the complete instructions according to your home conditions."
9,2021-06-27,4,Good and efficient,"Good and sturdy.Very efficient.Exchange was smooth and hassle free.Wash and rinse cycles are really quiet but sometimes the spin cycle is a bit noisy but not at a bothering level.There is an option to change temperature in every wash cycle you choose. You just need to click on the touch button.Child lock is available to restrict kids from changing the cycle or pressing the touch screen button.Reload button helps you to add or remove any clothes while the machine is on.Spin is very efficient. Clothes are drier than they were in our old Samsung washing machine which means they dry up faster.We exchanged a 12 year old top load 6.2kg Samsung washing machine while buying this. Even though this one is 7kg, my observation is that this one can take fewer clothes than my old one.One downside is that this doesn‚Äôt have any handles or provision on the sides to lift it up while shifting.Please note the below:Firstly, It is brand installation which means Amazon will not order demo and installation from Bosch. So, please call Bosch and request for demo and installation immediately after you receive the delivery.We were misguided by the delivery person and unnecessarily lost time waiting that Bosch would contact us. We actually unboxed and installed by ourselves taking help from internet.Second, please purchase ‚Äú ELITE PRODUCTS Bosch and IFB Thread Type Faucet Water Tap Adapter for Washing Machine Inlet Pipe‚Äù from Amazon or any other similar one you find. You will need this if you have the kind of faucet I have shown in my photos. This adapter is not easily found in hardware stores. So better order this together when you order the washing machine.Overall I‚Äôm very satisfied with the product.Highly recommended."

12,2022-09-15,4,Nice,Nice product....
13,2022-05-30,5,Excellent and Affordable,"Review after 4 months regular useProbably the best choice at the priceWashing much better than Top Load machine which technology I've been using for almost 15 years. Wish I had gone Front Load much earlier. Much less water use compared to top load and 1200rpm spin speed gives better drying.No vibration or stability issues as reported by others.  Mine runs quite quiet. Think the problem others are having is due to installation issues like not being placed on a level surface.The machine is really, really heavy and extremely difficult to move., so take care."
14,2022-06-30,4,Good one,"Reviewing it after 4 years, it is very good one, washes clothes very well. No issues with the machine"
15,2020-09-23,4,Good Buy,"When i was planning to exchange my Samsung Front load Washing machine, was bit skeptical on the other brands.  Since i was looking the product in budget range but with best features, was unable to come to conclusion on the product.This Particular product has been suggested by one of my friend and later i started to check the reviews and this was quite satisfactory and i made a deal to buy this during offer time.  I got this for almost 24K with exchange and the product was delivered in time.The product is too heavy and this added the advantage of low vibration.  And Noise is very less and the time takes by this machine is comparatively lesser with my earlier one.  So far it is going good.But only issue what i found is on the service part, as they are not fast as Samsung or LG.  After placing your service request you need to wait for 1 or 2 days.  And secondly the service persons try to push some accessories and you can decide whatever you feel it is right to you.Since Bosch is my first experience, even i have taken there extended warranty for 3 more years.  Hope the machine will be trouble free even in future"
16,2022-01-01,5,Great product.. good service,"My 1st machine was delivered with some damage so I sent it back and ordered another after 15 days. The machine now delivered is good and the performance is also great.I had read a lot of reviews some of which were about bad installation services and panel button being hard. I had a very pleasant installation experience. The person arrived on time, installed the machine quickly he even did not accept any help to move the machine to the installation place and did is independently. Gave a complete demo and answered all our questions. Did not sale us any additional accessories. Overall a very pleasant experience.The touch panel buttons are very soft and easy to use, contrary to the feed back I read. So pleasently surprised.Tha nosie level is very low.Overall a great product and good service. Very happy with both"
17,2020-12-29,5,Washing made easy,"We've been using a top load semi-automatic(Double drum type) for 2 decades. Moving to a fully automated front load was like moving from a Maruti 800cc car to a BMW .  We just love it that we can simply load in the clothes , shut it, let it do its work and take  out 80% dry clothes (at 1200 rpm spin)  after an hour.  The machine is very sleek, not noisy .  As far as features is concerned, I really don't know as I don't segregate  the clothes and wash. it's always in the Mixed load mode & we are happy with the outcome.  If you have soaked the clothes externally and just want to rinse & dry, it will do it. You do have quick wash for 30 minutes.  The anti -Tangle is nonsense, put in 9 yards Dhoti / Sari and you can be rest assured its tangled.  One thing you need to know is that at 1200 rpm it will draw power at 1900 to 2300 Watts(says so at the back panel of the machine) , hence you have to make sure that your power circuit brake is at 16 Amps so the power doesn't trip when going to 1200 rpm spin mode. However, the machine doesn't really guzzle power .To conclude, this is the latest model from Bosch as on Oct 2020. Bosch is a trusted brand and are doing good in this segment hence, you can take the plunge for this product."
18,2021-11-09,5,Happy purchase!,After reading tons of front loading washing machines (FLWM) from different brands- I decided to go for Bosch. Simply because they are the best in the market when it comes to FLWMs.Pros:1. Amazon large appliances delivery was very prompt. Asked me to check the machine for any damages in their presence which were none in my case.2. Very easy to use.3. Clothes seem fresher and less crumpled after a wash.Only cons are:1. The power adapter wire is a bit short.2. The touch sensitive buttons require a double tap at times even though they seem feather touch.3. Atrocious pricing on accessories from Bosch (but that‚Äôs another story) I had to spend 700 on a cover and 2000 on Stand from Bosch (all through Amazon)4. Service advisor/installation team from Bosch was hard selling their products which I politely refused.Go for additional warranty directly from Bosch website and enjoy this machine for years to come.
19,2021-09-16,4,Silent and economical wash m/c,"What we liked the build quality and looks. It takes 45 minutes for the mix load cold water wash, consumes only 30-40 litre water depending on load, and produces very less noise. Good that it remembers last used program. In hot weather days, we use a spin speed of 600 rpm and it's enough to dry clothes the next day. We can choose the water temperature and spin speed from predefined values. What I didn't like is that it's too heavy to move, and it leaves some drops of water near the door in the gasket. Overall, it's good and we're happy using it."
20,2017-07-08,1,Bosch recall this nonsensical machine!,"I bought this at a local store with whom I have an ongoing financing option at Rs.31000 and not on amazon; I thoroughly read the reviews here before taking an informed decision to buy this machine.  Its the stupidest washing machine in existance and I regretted this decision from the moment the technician arrived to install it and from the very first wash cycle! Had no issue with technician, he came very next day for installation and did not charge for the service. Firstly, the length of the water inlet tube provided was too short and I had to purchase a longer one; can't understand how this big company 'Bosch' expects everyone to place their machine right next to water inlet with out giving a little flexibility to the customers! Secondly, the guy wanted us to buy an adapter to fix to the tap (it was just fine for my previous Siemens machine). Can't understand why all these parts specific to the Bosch make cannot be supplied by manufacturer itself as part of the machine? After Rs.500 of additional expenses the machine was set up (got a local tube & adapter, the Bosch one was exorbitantly priced!).  Before purchasing this machine, I had read in the reviews about The ""dreaded"" E17 error alert caused by inadequate water supplied to the machine. I specifically asked the Bosch  dealer about this and he said the if the minimum flow is 8 lts of water per  minute then we are fine. The flow from my inlet is double this and still I get the AWFUL E17 error beep almost during every wash!  Every time, I have to be around during the wash ( I cannot leave it on and go out) to hit the restart button, after which the machine does not resume working by drawing more water but this stupid machine increases the wash time again! ABSOLUTELY FRUSTRATING!! After all this anxiety it does not even give a good wash. I was told that at 7kg capacity I can load up to 3/4 of the drum height or approximately 14 normal size clothes. When I do this most of the clothes come out with dry patches on them because the water has not even touched those parts!! So, I add only 7/8 clothes for each wash. I found my old Siemens machine was more silent during operation. The spin cycle does make some noise. Took the time to write this review so that you guys know about  the hard time I'm having with this machine. Sharing pics of dry patches after washing in this machine."
21,2022-07-10,3,Water pressure issue,"I was very excited to get the washing machine, However i was told by the engineer during installation that the water pressure is not  sufficient. I have raised a request for the same with customer care team. Kindly check water pressure  at your location before booking"
22,2020-10-30,5,BOSCH is Boss....of All...!!,"I purchased this product on 16th October 2020. In the sale of Grate India festival. I got bank offer also. After all i paid 25.5K. I think it is a better deal for BOSCH WAJ2426SIN model. After opening of my washing machine i found some water in door knobs and at drain door also. Im think it is used piece. Technitian explained that testing purposes they run the machine. So need not vorry about it.Installation take 1 day extra time. What they promised. But installation person good. He explained well. Washing machine first impression is good. Noice level is very low. Machine doesn't vibrate. Im not using stand. Performance also good.  Am Little bit doubtful for new touch model. No one given reviews about this model. So im douted about performance of this model. After using of one week. Im saying that it is a best model. And value for money. The technitian says that this model have inverter moter. It saves the power consumption. Im very happy of selecting for this BOSCH company and this model.  Im searching any enquiries so many companies and models at shoping malls, friends.. finally i bought this model..  For 4 to 5 members family blindly choose this 7kg model. Tq Bosch n Amazon"
23,2019-02-13,5,Superb. Excellent for 4-5 family members.,"First time I am buying an expensive product online. Everything went smooth for me with this product. Exchange discount, instant discount with credit card, amazon delivery, installation and of course the machine. It has been 3 months since we started using.  I got it for 24,000/- (includes exchange discount of 2000/-). Best thing I like is clothes come out fresh and looks new.Prior to this we used to own an LG top loading machine 6.5 kg but this machine is far far....better w.r.t. cleaning, water usage, electricity consumption, less detergent, very less sound except while drying. Full respect to German engineering. I bought the stand and cover, also the drum cleaner powder from the installation guy itself and they are of good quality too. Stand is fixed at one place. Make sure it is balanced and machine does not vibrate while drying. i think stand is necessary so that we can clean the floor under the machine else it almost touches the floor.Few tips for less electricity consumption: Unless if it is required run the machine mostly in 30¬∞c. (daily wash). Higher temp. will consume more power.  If ur staying in a home where u can dry ur clothes in the sun then u can decrease the rpm to 800. Default is 1200. If not in hurry u can disable Speed Perfect option which if disabled takes more time to wash but consumes less power. Use 15'/30' program for mild wash and less clothes."
24,2022-08-13,5,Great Product by bosh,"This is a very good Product, will recommend it built quality is excellent. Washing and sound is also very good.The technical team came in just 1 day and installed the machine."

26,2021-03-30,4,Great product üëå,Writing this review after 20 days of usage.I was a bit sceptical before purchasing this model. But after doing lots of research I chose this one and to be honest I am really happy with the product so far.The wash quality is really good. I'm getting 80% dry clothes after wash due to 1200 rpm.But it can't wash hard stain properly.The eco silent drive works perfectly. I'm getting very less noise and vibration during wash & spin cycle (without any stand).The only con is it's white colour. It's prone to get dirty. So if you can stretch your budget go for a different colour option.Please go ahead if you want to buy this model.
27,2019-10-24,5,Best Washing Machine I've Used.,"I had Whirlpool Top Load Washing Machine and I got it Exchanged with Bosch.Here is my review after 1 Months Usage.Pros1.  All Clothes are Super clean after wash.  I could literally make out the difference by looking at the clothes.  In my Old Top Load Machine, I could easily see the Left Over Dirt on clothes after Wash, and I was never really Happy, but I am quite happy with Bosch as it cleans all clothes very well.2. Water Consumption is Way too Less in Bosch.  The Top Load Machine fill the Entire Drum with Water and then it twists to clean the Clothes.  however in Front Load, it uses the Water only to to Wet the Clothes which reduces the amount of Water usage by a drastic amount.3. Amount of Noise is comparatively less.4. Unloading the clothes are super Easy, you just to keep a basket below the Front door and pull all clothes down.  I find this very Helpful :)Cos:The Machine actually does not vibrate on Normal speed or While it is in Washing Mode.  However it tend to a vibrate a Bit while the machine spins at maximum speed.  I dont see that as a Problem though.I have not faced anyother issues with the Unit so far, and I do not have anything to commend on Negative Side.  I hope the Machine Lasts Long as I have invested a lot of Money for this.I have bought an additional Stand for the Washing Machine for Bosch (Rs 3000). This is kept in my utility, and we usually Pour Water on Floor to clean the Surface and a Stand was Essential."
28,2022-08-15,1,It's waste of money. Don't buy this washing machine.,"I bought this Bosh front load washing machine 7.0kg in the year November 2019, Hardly we used it for less than 6months and there after more than 18months it was kept idle. As we went to home town and continued office related works at my native place through work from home option. We recently came back to Chennai and started using this washing machine, but this is not working properly, when we start the machine by opting Quick wash mode. The ideal time to complete quick wash job is 44min, but it takes 75mins or even more, due to the reason the time indicated on the screen get jumped automatically and when we wait till the job get complete, the door would not open and we receive an E17 error on the screen, when we managed to open the door and take away the clothes from the drum. The clothes not at all washed properly and also we could see the detergent is still lying on clothes and also the clothes are more wet, just like you dipped the clothes in a full bucket of water. We have called the customer care and raised the complaint. They have arranged a technician to diagnose the problem. Day before yesterday the technician has come and revealed us that the pump and the inlet hose got completely destroyed, so the reason only the machine behaves abnormal. He charged 6400 INR for the spare parts replacement. In my home town my parents are using Samsung front load washing machine for the last 10years till now no complaint at all even my brother is also useig the samsung top load and got good feedback. I tried Bosh differently with the notion on the brand but I really felt bad for the wrong choice."
29,2020-08-30,4,Wash quality is Good,"Overall Machine is very good, i will give 4/5.Handling is bit confusing but after couple of wash you can do it easyly it will not bother you.Wash quality is also superb no doubt.Machine makes bit noise and vibrates bit while spinning but it is giving good results so you can ignore it.Size is bit bulky than other machine.Installation service i took over video call and it was good, before machine start you need to do appropriate plumbing work, that service guy will suggest you.Drum size is actually large comparitively other segment machines. You can put 5 shirt 5 pant 1 or 2 towel in 7k machine.It is water saving machine for normal mode of washesIt takes 50l water for 1 wash which is very important.Just i have not checked about hot water, i don't know how to check it"

31,2021-05-17,4,Nice washing machine,"This is a nice washing machine , we bought about one and a half years ago. It has been performing well without any issues ever since. The noise and vibration level is NOT as high as some other brand washing machines (read IFB). Cleaning level is alright(not awesome!) and dries the clothes well. I bought it for around 23k and it has been worth the money. Only issue I have with is the customer service which hasn't delivered my extended warranty document till date. I wonder how they would serve the customers if something goes wrong with the machine !"
32,2022-08-20,5,Simply best,"Bosch a name we can trust.Silent,excellent wash quality,and easy setting once we understand the wash cycles.Would recommend to anyone."

35,2021-02-01,4,"I'm marginally Happy with the product, Giving 4 star due to electric shock","I am writing this review after 3 months of usage.Cons :1.When you touch backside of machine.. You will feel sever electric shock sometimes. I don't know it might be  power grid  socket issue or not.2.Duration varies randomly sometimes despite any problem which leads to deply in wash. (varies 10-15 min)Pros :Easy to useGives you many options for wash based on fabric type.Noise is very less, can notice slight increase after severely usage.Wash quality is good based on setting(can expect good for mix load)"

40,2021-07-20,5,Peace of Mind!,"Excellent product. Far better than semi-automatic which I exchanged with this purchase.Overall, very happy with the product. Comact yet powerful and does the job perfectly. At times front loaded washing machines could be expensive, but the kind of ease of washing they provide is priceless.it's a 5-star rated washing machine. Plenty of wash modes. Works pretty silently.Would recommend to everyone.Only Con for some: It requires a permanent water tapP.S. You may need to buy accessories (stand, cover) additionally at the time od installation or from local market or on Amazon etc from different seller."
41,2018-11-06,5,"Quiet, Powerful and does the job well !","Writing this review after 15 days post receiving the product.The Bosch WAK24618IN washing machine is one of the best out there in the market in the 7KG capacity. After Much research selected this product and below are the details along with Pros and Cons :-Also note for those where the above mentioned model is not available for delivery in their area then you may choose WAK20164IN the only difference is the RPM is 1000 and the available color is white :-)Pros :-1) Stainless Tub2) 7 KG capacity3) @1200 RPM the noise levels is extremely low and hence quiet whilst the spinning and draining is being done.4) The quality of wash is good and the clothes are almost dry, definitely helpful in monsoon season.Cons :-1) Ordered the product on 12th Oct and received the delivery on 20th whilst installation was done after 5 days post follow up although it's supposed to be done within 48 hours. This is the trend of almost all the reviews by those customers who have purchased the product. I've ordered the the WAK20164IN washing machine through their competitor for my relatives and they've done a fabulous job.2) At the time of the installation the Bosch executive will ask you to pay Rs 300/- towards adaptor charges.3) The Bosch Executive will also try to sell you Bosch Descaler worth Rs 610/- followed by Bosch Washing Machine Cover Worth Rs 850/- and lastly followed by a Washing Machine Stand for Rs 2999/- all these can be purchased for a better price online or a known service provider in your locality who retails related products."
42,2016-10-25,4,Product quality is good and it wash well though,"I have been using this for over a month now, atleast weekly twice. Product quality is good and it wash well though. Though 8-10 wash programs are given with all preset timings, but it would have been good if given a option to customize the timings for every particular stage of a wash based on our requirement which we can't do which lacks it. For every program the wash time is minimum 2hrs unless you select 'speed select' option which wash faster and finish in half of its kind of normal program time however its expensive to use this option every time in terms of power usage :)For installation n demo, the demo guys are ok, visited within 48 hrs of my registration call on their toll free number, while registration you need to first ask for their person to visit first and perform the pre-installation checks looks ok in terms of tap slot, water pressure, size etc and as expected for installation before technician visit and install the product. As told by technician that only max two visits given to customer for installation and demo. Technician insist you buy their accessories but they are many times costlier than of same quality available in market, anyway its upto you to buy or not.Overall my experience with it is good so far..you can buy this washing machine.!"
43,2019-09-09,4,"Thanks to Amazon, but Bosch to work on Demo team...","Thanks to Amazon for delivering on time and promised. Post delivery for demo I have contacted Amazon and it was told it is scheduled but while contacting Bosch Customer care they said no request available from Amazon and taken request for Demo and Installation.Bosch customer care team was good and arranged demo in short notice. Main problem starts with Demo guy, who no knowledge, no patience and time for the Demo. Due to water tap, Power Socket requirement demo can not be done in one go which was not told by Bosch to keep it ready. Demo guy was 3 party individual and was only interested in completing the formality. On asking many basic questions he got irrigated. Bosch company should seriously think on this and must take right actions. Now almost month or so elapsed and I am happy with the machine. Body looks sturdy, Glass inside good. Overall its value for money."
44,2019-09-02,5,Absolute gem of a machine,"Absolute gem of a machine. It has been 2 years since I bought this washing machine and  now I literally cannot imagine how I would wash my clothes without it. I will give you 2 examples to explain it's performance. I am from North india and we play holi with real colours, not the gulal crap. After playing holi I washed my jeans at 60 degree water temperature and now you cannot make out that I played holi in those jeans. I once washed my shirt with huge ink stains on it. Nobody could tell afterwards. However there are 2 practicalities that you have to consider when buying this product.1. Some times builders don't make washing space in flats keeping in mind this washing machine size. They make it as per semi automatic top wash design. You have to figure out where you are going to install it (based on its size) before buying it.2. Bosch service guys are great (trust me) but they work based on their process. Meaning they are not plumbers who will install taps and everything. You will have to provide a ready water connection based on their specifications.It has been 2 years and not a single complaint and no any maintenance has been done. I have changed locations as well. After all this the product works flawlessly."
45,2019-10-25,4,Honest Review,"I'll give an honest review about the product, 1st thing first; delivery of the product was pretty smooth without any damages.Machine functions pretty smoothly and the wash is also decent,The only challenge that I faced was regarding the customer service; I had to call the customer care  several times to make my installation process happen and that was also made possible after I contacted the Branch manager of Kolkata, who by the way is an excellent manager, as he got it done in no time and is also kind enough to ask for the feedback.Now, it's my personal experience and as I am a resident of Asansol (West Bengal), it may be possible that there was a problem in communication with the service centre in this area (in particular), but as a whole the product and company are trustable."
46,2022-07-20,5,All my washing problems solved,"Buyers who can afford few thousand bucks extra, must go for it. Its really value for money."
47,2022-07-16,5,Best washing machine of front load type,"Best quality of wash, hassle free, use surfexcel front load detergent to get best results, value for money"
48,2020-06-09,4,Delay in service,The washing machine is one of the great choices you can make in the market but I rated it low only due to the delay and lag in services.The machine arrived late and took another week and a half to get installed. I had to make multiple calls everyday to the customer centre.Even though the response took time it was genuine due to the covid situation. The Bosch company person did the installation very professionally and gave a great demo.This order will be a good choice but only if you have the patience to sail through multiple follow ups.
49,2023-02-21,1,Stopped working in 2.5 year,"Fault appear in circuit, cost of replacing circuit is 9000..."
50,2020-02-26,5,Washing quality,"It's been 4 months since I got this washing machine. Got a good deal from amazon during the BIG SALE event. The delivery was on time and the customer support team contacted immediately after and was lucky enough to get it installed in the very next day. I also purchased a Bosch Siemens Original Square Frame Pedestal for my washing machine which makes us easy to clean the bottom area without even lifting or pushing aside. And the best thing is even after placing it on the pedestal frame the machine doesn't shake. It remains stable.I have felt my clothes remain soft even after multiple washes.I found that one can go for it if you want the following:Less noiseSturdiness; doesn't shakeBetter washing quality.Even though it says we can use washing powder, I have felt that it leaves some residue in the inlet area which needs to be cleaned. I would suggest to go for washing liquid rather than powder along with little bit of comfort (not a must though) for a freshness."
51,2020-09-25,5,Prime German Technology certain to satisfy who believes in Quality and perfection in Product.,"Delivery- Before time. Ordered on 19.09.2020 and got delivered on 21.09.2020 against probable date of devlivery 25.09.2020Installation: Very responsive and responsible team, they themselves called up and detailed about the requirements before installation and detailed about the working, maintenance, load details, water requirements etc very clearly.Requirements other than power connection before installation: 1. 3/4"" tap connection with adapter to suit 3/4"" water filter. 2. The Outlet line shall be atleast 1' deep from top of the machine.If required: Bosch made washing machine stand (Rs.2000), cover(Rs 800), descaling agent(Rs.600), Bosch liquid wash(Rs.280)Noise levels: when compared to top loading machines, NILVibration: almost NIL when the floor is flat.Ease in Use: Very easy to use. All Programs are preset and one just need to turn the knob and select which one required."
52,2019-06-27,5,Can't find any better washing machine.,"I did so many R&D about washing machine and came to this conclusion that Siemens or Bosch. As I read somewhere IFB is using Bosch's motor so I chose Bosch over IFB. Wanted to buy some machine where any body can wash their clothes without any problem so this was my finding. I bought this machine on 21st Jan, 2019 and it was delivered 24th Jan, 2019. It was installed withing 48 hours and installation guy was so friendly. He was not like sales person. I bought heavyduty stand with this machine but he suggested not to have this as machine will make lot of noise so I returned that. He himself set machine at the place where I asked him to do that without any help as I was so confused that how would he manage to shift my machine to required place as this washing machine is so heavy. He instructed me very well for all program. Electricity consumption is very pocket friendly when washing program is set to Daily Wash. It cost me 5 rs for 45 min program in Daily was which is justified. I have been using this machine for 6 months and I haven't found even a single problem."
53,2017-03-01,4,"Machine is worth the buy, good quality wash","It's been a month, going goodDemo and installation was free and it was good.Any external things like connector taps etc.. buy it yourselves, they will inflate the amount  if u ask them to get it, u can ask them and buy it before they come.Machine wash quality is good, it will dry 70 percent.Sound less when compared to other machinesMake sure service is available if u r buying in tier 2 cities or from rural, it covers lots of places ask I knowWashing modes for all type of clothes programmes are available.One important thing make sure the water pressure from tap which is intake for machine has enough pressure. It should fill 1 liter bottle of water in 14 seconds as informed by customer care, they were helpful. If not enough water pressure you may need to buy additional equipment which may increase pressure, talk to customer care.Make sure the machine registration happened by calling customer care for warranty claiming,DO not place machine on any stand especially 7kg machine. Installation staff told warranty will void if placed on stand, it's good news u don't have to buy one"
54,2015-09-25,5,Wonderful washing machine,"I had a lot of hesitation in ordering a washing machine online, inspite of Amazon's assurance and seller's credibility. I orderd this in Amazon after a lot of deliberations and I was rewarded. The price quoted by the seller was around 2K lesser than the retailers. In addition Amazon's gift voucher of 2.5K for purchasing large appliances made this a steal deal.This is an amazing washing machine, works like a charm. Cleans even the dirt on collars and cuffs. It washes everything clean from a hanky to a bedsheet without any fuss. Best part is the machine remains so silent, even during spin period, so low that even a baby wouldnt be disturbed from its sleep.The machine was delivered the same day of order. Amazing price by the seller KCS Shop and an expedited delivery. Hats off..Only trouble was with the installation and Demo. I would have given it only 4 stars considering the time taken by the Bosch customer service for setting up the installation and demo. I had called up the Bosch toll free number and had to follow up with them so many times to get the installation and demo completed. I believe i would have atleast called up the service executive and his manager with respect to the Installation/Demo some 25 to 30 times. The installation and demo happened only after 5 days speaks for the service quality.It would have been better if the installation and demo was arranged either by the seller (KCS Shop) or Amazon. Neither of them cared after the product was delivered which was the only glitch in the experience. Flipkart arranges the installation and demo on behalf of the customer and ensures it is done in the stipulated time."
55,2020-06-22,4,Good machine with worst service/installation team from the company,"Writing this review after using the machine for one week.Pro‚Äôs>> more programs>> good wash quality>> less noise>> can change RPM level>> can add clothes in middle of the wash>> quick wash program (15/30 minutes)Con‚Äôs>> worst installation and worst service>> worst call centre>> Make sure to buy a stand if your floor is not even, else the machine will vibrate a lot>> installation guy will try to sell more products. They charged 250 rs for a nob to fit the inlet pipe to the tap"
56,2022-01-15,4,Few months later it starts wobbling a lot and make to much noise while spinning,Few months later it starts wobbling a lot and make to much noise while spinning
57,2020-09-19,5,"Aesthetically classy, performance neat","It's been a month since we bought it and here are the first impressions:- Installation was neat and happened within 24 hours- The machine has a good spinner which makes the washed cloths not needing your twisting to remove water- There is no ""no spin"" feature if you prefer that way; that's a bit of a dissapointment as some other brands have that feature- The spin noise and vibration is as much as expected and not something alarming.- Aesthetically the build is classy; buy the cover from Bosch as well- The ultra fast 15 mins wash is an useful option when you really don't want a deep washOverall, I feel I am satisfied about what I bought."
58,2016-07-14,4,Quality Product Less Money,"Product is very good after using it for 20 days I am writing this review.  I am using this washing machine everyday for 1 hour with maximum cloth capacity of  35 cloths of daily use I found my increase in electricity bill by only Rs. 100, so it consumes less power.  After contacting the installation the engineer visited within 24 hrs for installation.  He advised not to mount on the trolley so no need to purchase the trolley. The unit is working without any noise and vibration.  Previously I used to wash cloths manually in hands, because Bosch cost was high I had decided if  wish to buy a Washing Machine it should be Bosch now the prices have come down without compromising in quality.  Now from the day I received it's almost drizzling in Bangalore the cloths will dry inside the washing upto 70 percent, remaining 30 percent I should put for drying manually. The price with local dealer was Rs 10 K higher when compared to amazon for 1000 rpm.  I have received 1200 rpm for lesser price then our local dealer."
59,2021-09-22,5,Best Machine and Best Service!,Installation and delivery was really nicely and professionally done... ‚ù§Ô∏è Loved the overall experience! It was my first time buying a machine online and I'm quite happy with the buying decision! Was really worried about the extra facilities but it was done and dusted at a good time within a day!! Thankyou Amazon for such a beautiful service! The machine is really well conditioned and the noise level and functioning is absolutely amazing!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
60,2020-08-26,5,Best in the market.,"Honestly speaking this machine is doing its work very intelligently and washes my clothes (all types) in a very good way. It's not that much noisy as I was assuming it to be. Only a bit of noise you will get when it's  drum rotates for 'Spin/Drain' (but that's not disturbing at all). It's very normal to happen when something rotates in 1200 rpm.  I'm not going into more technical details, but it has thoroughly satisfied me with its performance in these 15 days. One thing the buyers need to keep in mind to keep the place of installation and the point for electricity connection ready as instructed by the company, before the installation engineer arrives. (I had a bit of issue with that)"
61,2022-02-24,4,Easy to use,Perfect watching machine for 4M family
62,2020-08-12,5,Perfection from Bosch,"Got the delivery yesterday, nice transportation and handling from Amazon.The machine is heavy and sturdy, no vibration. I called the Bosch toll free number on the day of delivery for installation request and got same day visit for installation. Great and quick service from Bosch.Had to buy the inlet pipe (genric) as the inlet pipe provided by Bosch don't come with adaptor to fit with the tap. And only adaptor was hard to find in the local market. So the pipe cost me 300 Rs.I guess Bosch should atleast provide such small accessories to fit in..Max washing temperature in this model is 60 degree however the model just above this is having 90 degree max washing temperatureOver all satisfied with the product."
63,2022-09-18,2,After sale service is very bed and costly,After sale service is very bed and costly. I have purchased in 2018. Now machine PCB is become defective. After 30 days of  complain no spares is provided. Also they demand high cost for repair.
64,2020-09-06,4,DISAPPOINTMENT:,This review I am writing...After puchased this machine simply kept for 8Month without using.I started using from July2020 and within 2month of Use BOSCH Machine..................PROBLEM:Electricity is showing in machine but DOOR IS NOT GETTING LOCKED and NO RESPONSE after clicking on start button.POINT OF DISAPPOINTING:1) Ideally I have started using this machine from July2020 and within 2month of Use machine is in HANDS UP mode.
65,2021-08-08,5,Awesome product with great quality features,"Hi I am writing this review after usage of this machine for a week. The delivery experience is not so good this time. The delivery guys refused to deliver the machine first floor & they have just put the package near outer gate. Anyhow we shifted the package. Amazon need to clearify the doorstep delivery little more. Second part is machine performance, the machine is having robust designe & awesome performance with minimal noise level."
66,2021-08-04,5,Overall Great washing machine,"Bosch washing machine is reliable. The installation was done by the company rep on same day as delivery. He explained us everything clearly. The washing machine was in good state and had no defects.Washing and drying quality is good which is visible in the clothes after the cycle. Water usage is ample, But you can always use an eco mode. For maintenance use certified Bosch descaler and clean the dirt collector once a month."
67,2018-11-21,4,Received a washing machine with a dent on the side,"I received a washing machine that had a slight dent on the right side. It wasn't a major deal breaker as the price I payed was still worthwhile. Getting a replacement seemed more combersom.The bosch service personnel arrived at site within 48hrs. Knowledgeable and efficient guy. Charged me 300/- for an adapter and 1500/- for a water softner.Demonstrated the functionality.Have now been using this washing machine for about a month and haven't faced any issues.To prevent any vibration, Ensure that you check the balance of the washing machine using a sprit gauge along its length and breadth especially if you place your washing machine on a stand.I am using a a stand to ensure that the drained water which on the floor on doesn't come in contact with the machine.So despite the minor dent on the right side, I am a happy customer.5-Jun-20202 years put into use, the washing machine is still going strong."
68,2020-09-04,5,BeST...its BOSCH....,The BEST BRAND washing machine ....‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê. We have upgraded from semi automatic to this front loading ...I was in dilemma if it will be worth the price .....I was taken  by surprise...first BOSCH product........The installation was done with much professionalism.....the legs were balanced so well and no noise is heard or even any rotation sound but a smooth hiss of the drum rotating while drying mode works. The product had a slight dent on its side but not major one. The machine comes with energy star rating which can be understood by looking into the guide. My wifeis a nurse and since she was in covid ward we required hot water washing option which this provide .
69,2019-11-22,5,‚úå,"The product overall is amazing. Bosch having it's own standard is not the one attracting customers by providing a lot of features, it has its name because of excellence in all the features provided.The only problem I face is always some amount of detergent or foam is left near the door on the rubber rim. It irritaes because every time before taking clothes out you need to clean it. Once it even happened that the powder was stuck there during the washing time n in the rinse period the water got foamy because the powder was then dissolved.Ignoring the above stated issue the washing is excellent. Testing the water removed during every rinse period came out to be more soapy n foamy than expected but on the contrary the clothes were thoroughly cleaned better than handwashed. So the water can be ignored.Tip: If using detergent powder do not put it in the tray, instead sprinkle it accordingly over the clothes in the main drum for better efficiency."
70,2022-03-06,4,Good,Good
71,2019-03-02,5,The best in Class,"I had bought the washing Machine about a Month back and was waiting for sometime before I write a review.Pros.1. The best one within the budget on a front load2. the clothes gets washed much better and probably slightly faster than my old Top Load machine3. Less water usage compared to top load4. various setting available to start the wash cycle only after a few hours so that everything gets washed on time when you get back from office5. the 1200rpm spin speed gives the clothes enough dryness so that even keeping for a couple of hours on the cloth stand would get everything dry almost including the Jeans6. Online extended warranty available from BSH through AmazonCons,1. When running at 1200 rpm modes the machine gets heated up2. Quite heavy in case if you plan to shift to any other places within the flat"
72,2022-07-06,5,BEST OF BEST WASHING MACHINE,VERY GOOD WASHING MACHINE. EVERY ONE BUY THIS WASHING MACHINE.
73,2020-12-03,5,It's a Bosch!,"I don't think any other brand sells its product citing it's brand recall like Bosch does.This purchase was primarily because It's a Bosch: My decision to go for another brand with washer dryer with higher rpm etc was nixed with, 'Why not Bosch?' Thanks also to the festival pricing.The delivery and  installation happened smoothly.Silent; time saving; quicker to dry; and consumes less electricity (reflects in the bill); easy user interface... and it's a Bosch.The previous washing machine (IFB) continues to work for more than 15 years.Hope this one also works for a long time to come.Hope to upgrade in 2035."
74,2022-07-22,5,VFM product,works as expected
75,2017-10-24,5,The story behind buying a Bosch,"It's been about a month since we got this fine piece of German engineering - Bosch's Series 4 washing machine (WAK24168IN) - with some good discount on Amazon and a generous exchange offer for our 10-year old Samsung Fuzzy logic.Just a month isn't really reasonable time to say it's super quiet, economical with detergent and superior in wash quality, because these appliances must able to continue doing all those for half-a-decade. I hope it continues to. But for now, what matters the most is the missus is clearly impressed :). I've seen an IFB and a Samsung (front loaders) irritating their owners on a regular basis. 'IFB now has new technology which eliminates all such glitches' So I am told by the salesmen in Hyderabad's showrooms who stock near identical models with just one tiny change in the last letter of the model number (which could just mean they're sold via brick and mortar). I hear 'they are in damage control mode now' ;). Despite all their convincing...I tell myself, 'not until I hear improvement from another user'. Finally, Bosch it was and via Amazon.Of course, the installation peeps stretched our patience to the limits before sending an engineer, who installed the thing well. Btw, the extended warranty at 4k+ didn't fit our logic but we did spend an additional 4k for a Bosch cover and sturdy stand.That's the story for now folks. Hope you find it helpful."
76,2020-06-23,5,You deserve it!,"What else to say about a product that gives you its very best each time you do your laundry? It's a quiet performer you can blindly buy. It is easy to operate and it keeps families happy! The maintenance may be a little more expensive than competitors, but can competitors ever match Bosch? Before, Bosch we had an American brand which we didn't use much as it used to tear up our clothes. We bought our Bosch after a friend had recommended it. That guy had bought a second Bosch after the body of his first Bosch had completely rusted away. After having  our complete satisfaction with Bosch, the one bought from Amazon was for my in-laws. They are happy too."
77,2020-12-02,4,Good and sturdy....nice wash and dry at 1200 rpm...got for 22k during sale in oct 2020...,Got it for around 22k during sale...delivery by amazon and installation by the bosch is good..but he charged me for an adapter. quality of wash is good...sturdy and heavy weight...no vibrations even on stand....but am not happy with the noise (others review mentioned it is calm  which is not at all)..as per my expectations noise level should be more less
78,2021-07-02,4,It‚Äôs compact & neat in appearance,This machine lets you know the weight of the clothes that are added. This machine vibrates more on spin mode than the earlier BEKO brand that I was using. All other features are good as built in
79,2022-01-30,4,Good,Product is very good
80,2019-10-26,4,"Product is good, but Amazon delivery needs little improvement","Overall the product is good. I have been using bosch washing machines since last 8 years. I got good exchange value to my old one. There is some software issue, which  result the timer displays weird.Another issue is delivery with Amazon, two lean and small guys came to delivery this huge item. They could not lift properly, I have put lot of efforts (one side me and other side both of them) to lift the product to first floor. I request Amazon people should sent at least 3 people whenever they used to send this kind of heavy weight items"
81,2020-11-02,5,"Superb built quality,  amazing performance!!!","This machine is superb. I have bought this product during 2019 Amazon Great Indian Festival sale. It is quite heavy, not easy for a even 2 guys to deliver it on 2nd floor. I have been using this to and fro. The experience is amazing. Very less noise, washes cloth perfectly, not facing a single problem till now, receive calls from Bosch expert on quarterly basis for servicing.The only cons is 7kg is not suitable if you are having more than 2-3 members in family. I am happy to buy it from amazon. Loving it"
82,2020-09-11,5,Bosch 7kg review after one month  usage,After one month usage posting this review. BOSCH washing machine 7kg fully automatic. Really you can go with this model even if the family members of 3 also it suits. It does its job well. Quality of washing is good. We often use 'Speed Perfect' Mix load often. Other options take so much time for washing. In speed perfect mode take Appropriately 50mins - 1hr. Water consumption also very less compare to top load. Spinning sound also very less since it has silence filter to reduce the noise level. You can see my video spinning @ 1000 Rpm. Cloth also almost dry 90%. Better to use good detergent powder or liquid for more better result.
83,2015-06-19,4,The washing machine is really good for the price,"The washing machine is really good for the price. Excellent price from amazon.Pros:1 Extremely silent and hardly any vibration.2 seems like it uses very less water and electricity.3 clothes come out very clean but have to see if the wash damages them on the long run.4 we are a family of 3 but get lot of laundry, so this should be good for family of 4 too.Cons:1 Needs the water supply to have some certain pressure meaning your water tank has to be at 16 to 18 feet above the top of your washing machine. This is what the BOSCH service guy told, not sure how true it is. But this caused a huge confusion in my house as i wanted to keep the washing machine in first floor but BOSCH service guy told it was not possible and I had to move it to the ground floor, many people might not have this as a choice, so be careful before you buy it. Further no details of this is given any where."
84,2022-01-06,5,Cleaning is better than LG front load 5.5 kg model,"The options are adequate and cleaning is good so far , especially since we have had hard water and scaling problem.LG washing machine got corroded. Installation was good too. No hassles. Machine is pretty silent .. compared to previous model I had."
85,2020-09-17,5,A washing machine worth for money but bad delivery,"Overall washing machine is very niceüëçüëçBut one thing I disliked was it is very heavy for shifting,felt like need of wheels so that it can be moved easily and a fixed locking system when used during the time of washing.üòÉüòÉAnd delivery man also didn't do the door step delivery..he just left the washing machine in the ground floor even after requesting. Installation was done on the next day of the delivery and the staff was polite and professional. He really helped in placing the washing machine in right place. Only problem was with the Amazon delivery guy..rest everything is good"
86,2020-12-24,4,Satisfied with product except the way of delivery by Amazon,Satisfied with the product in all aspects. Problem with the delivery by Amazon.

I have done my research on many fully automatic front load machine n found this is the best one. If you are thinking of buying then go for it. After my mom saw this beautiful machine now she wants the same one.Pros :Washing quality is very good removes stains from white shirt like anythingConsumes less water n detergentVery stylish lookPowerful but consumes less electricityHeavy and durable no vibrationLiterally no soundGood programs for washing and it actually works goodTime savingEasy to useCan b used using extension plugConsVery heavy to move need to fix at a placeNeeds water pressureNeed 15amp socket to power upI am writing this review after 3 months of usage. This is a good washing machine and Amazon delivery is as always 5 star . Bosch customer care is not good they came to install the machine after 3 4 calls . Don't buy stuff from them they as usual tell some story to make you buy things from them. Installation is pretty easy. It was my 1st automatic machine so bit worried about how it will work but don't worry it's realy easy.
90,2019-10-20,5,One of the best front load options in India,"Switched to this machine after using a top load for more than 10 years.This machine is super silent, looks classy and does what is supposed to do..very well!! The clothes are clean and there are not detergent remnants. The water in our house is a little hard, but thanks to the heater function, that isnt too much of a problem.The clothes do not get tangled as they do in the top load machines.The dryer RPM can be set manually from 400 rpm to 1200 rpm. 1200 is very good as the clothes are almost dry.The tub size size seems a tad smaller though.There are various preset functions that can be used for washing delicates, cottons, etc.The installation was done on time and the guy who came was very knowledgeable and provided a good demo and answered all our questions."
91,2018-11-28,5,Very good performance. Not noiseless.,"This machine needs 16 A power outlet. I needed to buy a tap adapter to connect the water inlet pipe to water tap. Installation took 2-3 days from that day of raising request. Installation and demo by Bosch service person was satisfactory. Installed one month ago.Product feels robust and easy to use. There are many washing modes such as Cottons (cold,40 deg C, 60 deg C), Dailywash, Kidswear, Wool and some more. The max capacity of 7 Kg is available under Cottons and Kidswear option.There are two separate options -1) Speed - to speed up wash, but at reduced load. For eg, the maximum load under speed mode for Cottons is 4 Kg. The time reduces from 2 hr to 1 hr.2) Water Plus - Extra water rinsing action. Adds around 10 min to the time.There are specific load limits to each washing mode, for eg, dailywash can hold max 3.5 kg.  It is more than enough for a daily wash for a family of four.This is a fine product so far."
92,2022-11-28,1,Worst Washing Machine and Never buy anything from this seller,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†I have purchased from this seller and from the day of installation my washing machine started making lot of noise during washing and heavy vibration during the spinning time. I immediately contacted the installed person from Bosch team, he visited next day and he also noticed all the issues and informed to the concerned team. But even after 4 days of complaint registering, no one has responded and didn't solved the problem. Worst experience with the Bosch washing machine and their services team."
93,2019-10-09,5,Amazing Product | Speedy Delivery,I got this Washing Machine during the great indian sale for 24700/- with further discounts and amazon pay cashback worth 3K.The machine was delivered on time with absolutely crisp packaging with zero dents/damage. The manufacturing date was also new i.e June 2019. The delivery person came on time and was very professional. He tried selling me the stand but it is not required if the area remains dry. Just charged Rs. 100/- for the connector/adapter. He also informed that there are no visiting charges for the first 2 years in warranty. I read people mentioning Rs. 800 for visiting even during the warranty period. This is not true.The machine works like a charm and the clothes come out really clean and dry. Its a great product and should be bought eyes closed. Very satisfied with the product - 5*.
94,2020-08-16,5,"Awesome Product, value for money..best product","It's a great Product, I have uses mostly Semi-Automatic machines only. This is my first Fully Automatic Machine and I feel purchased the right product. The delivery is on time as they said and the installation & demo are very fast. Quick response from the Service center and in an hour the Technician (Mahuboob Basha) from Indian Enterprises came to my home for installation. He explained in a very understandable way. Even the Manager (Mr.Chakradhar) gave a very quick response, Service delivery is very quick..like in an hour. I was to give more than 5 stars..."
95,2020-12-05,5,My mom is happy!!,"It is very hard to impress my mom but Bosch washing machine did it! It is easy to use and the noise level is low and obviously value for money. Bought it during the festival sale this year and it cost me 26490/-. The delivery was quick but the people who delivered it was lazy and not cooperative at all. But, after using it for a month, no regrets!P.S. Buy a 3/4 inch water outlet beforehand for the machine."
96,2021-08-29,4,Nice Product,‡§ï‡§Æ ‡§™‡§æ‡§®‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•á ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§∂‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡•á ‡§Ö‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡§æ ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à .‡§Ü‡§µ‡§æ‡§ú ‡§ï‡§Æ ‡§Ü‡§§‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à .‡§ï‡§™‡§°‡•á ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ß‡•Å‡§≤‡§æ‡§à ‡§Ö‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡•Ä ‡§π‡•ã‡§§‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à .
97,2019-10-04,4,Machine is good. delivered in short time but installed Messed-up,"Installation did not happen as per schedule. Made complaint at Amazon but that also did not work. Had to call BOSCH directly they sent their person but he could only install & connect but did not have knowledge of machine modes etc.Water inlet pipe length is very important. It should be made selectible at the time of ordering. Length supplied with machine is 1.5 meter. If more length required then you have to purchase and call installer again. Invariably, installer bring their own and charge hefty for that."
98,2022-05-19,5,Everything about this washing machine is goodüòç,"It's been four 5years and it's superb, Bosch is the best....no noise at all"
99,2020-10-24,4,Noisy while spinning. Otherwise ok.,Noisy when spinning.. amazon uses same feature template for all bosch washing machine. Goto bosch website n check to confirm the features. This machine donot have silent wash feature. It makes considerable noise while spinning. There are machines with much less noise so be careful to note tge features of each model.
100,2021-08-09,5,Great machine but worst installation people,Installation people were rude and not helpful. They kept saying the machine wouldn‚Äôt fit. We had to direct and show them how to move the box and how to pick up the machine. They did not even end up putting where it needed to go - we got a neighbor to help instead.Happy with the machine itself
101,2020-03-07,4,The washing machine is great.,The washing machine is great. But Amazon service is terrible. Amazon service was suppose to complete the installation . But after repeated call to the customer care they did not complete the installation. Finally I contacted the BOSCH  Service center and the installation was done in next day. We are using the washing machine for a month now and we don't have any problem.
102,2019-11-21,4,Installation not done properly,Am writing this review after using one month. I bought two bosch one on last year another this year. Really value for money. Water consumption is less. Installation is not good. Once installations done I had a problem of shaking while draining the water. I called bosch customer care they send a engineer. And he fix that issue and now working fine. And he told its all because of the not proper Installation.
103,2017-08-14,5,"Happy with it, Good service by Amazon- Great Deal Price","This is my first experience buying a Large Appliance online. It was great deal during the Amazon Flash Sale after Exchange of my Old Machine for Rs3500 and i paid RS24590 for this after exchange. The delivery happened at the provided slot without any delay. Installation and demo was done on the second day after delivery by the Bosch Technician -(Saravanan from chennai).He was very courteous and he explained it very clearly and explaining all doubts been raised by me. The default inlet tube provided is short of length so i made some alternate adjustment for a new tap without increasing the length of the Inlet Tube( to avoid the water Pressure issue particularly). I bought a Adaptor from the technician for fixing  in the tap for Rs250. He did have new cover(Rs800), descaler powder (Around 2400 for 4 packs which can be used for an year) But i thought to buy these later after two months as the duration of cleaning with descaler is every 3 months.Yes, tried with different washing options and mode and it is quite brilliant.1200 RPM it's spinning like a flight takeoff. Happy with it's washing as well."
104,2022-10-07,1,Will not recommend Bosch Washing Machine,"I've been using IFB fully automatic washing machine for the past 8 years, but I wanted to purchase another one and purchased Bosch this time in 2019 end, this bosch washing machine stopped working after 2.5 years. The worst part is the customer care service is pathetic, it took them almost 20 days to fix the part. Earlier they said that the motor was not working and then when they found out that the motor was under warranty, they said the fault was with the timer display panel. Visiting charges are 700 + GST which is so unreasonable. In all, they took 5k to get it rectified after buying a good 32k model. I would never recommend bosch to any of my friends or relatives."
105,2020-09-10,5,Amazing Bosch Quality,"This is an excellant machine, especially if i compare it to my outgoing IFB washing machine which was an absolute disaster in terms of quality.This has amazing build quality with very low vibration, very silent operation, easy to use controls. Everything feels like its built to last. And 7 kg is perfect or sometimes more for a family of 5.This is definitely a recommended choice for anyone wanting to buy a hassle free washing machine.Installation Service could have been quicker."
106,2021-12-12,4,Makes noise,Noise level is high
107,2020-08-26,5,Excellent product matched by Excellent SERVICE,"We already own a BOSCH dishwasher ... so had no doubts on the quality,  however  we were a bit  skeptical reading  some mixed reviews  on Amazon regarding service but still  took a chance and ordered this product . The service guy was prompt and installed the  machine in less than 72 hours . Machine is super Silent and gives a Top class Wash ..... TOP CLASS STUFF WITH TOP CLASS SERVICE  and a great price point !!"
108,2021-01-10,4,Nice product but installation person explanation is very poor,Bosch brand working as it was expected and also the way is sound is very good. Only disappointed at the time of installation person was only concentrated of selling accessories not to explain the in and out of prodouct.very poor installation service....
109,2020-11-02,4,Good machine,This washing machine is really very good. Less noise with no vibration at all. But one thing i didnt like is that bosch does not provide a water adapter alongwith this machine. We had to purchase this adapter from the engineer who charged 250 rupees.
110,2020-10-25,4,Not expected this from Bosch,Delivered fast and Installation done on next day . 2 issues I am facing one is fabric fragant liquid is not taking at all and the second one mix load wash timing automatically increases by 10 minutes after some time without pressing perfect button .
111,2020-12-26,4,Ok Ok,"Bosch make really quality products,it's working fine, only concern is at high speed of rotation (1200rpm) vibration which it makes,by seeing this my mom really afraid like does it will give long life?üòÖI said let's see what will happen.üëç"
112,2017-10-14,4,"Excellent washing quality, very less noise, great procuct, delayed delivery, installation was average !!!!","Just installed the machine and I have seen great results on washing. Very minimal noise while spinning which is negligible always. Product was delayed from Amazon for 4 days. Installation guy gave some demo on all basic options only not in-depth. When I saw the user manual, I understood easily and more informative than the installation guy. He charged Rs.300 for tap adapter (a way of up selling by purposely designing a dust filter in such a way that never fits any kind of pipes and finally they can fit using their own adapter). Also, I purchased a authorized original Bosch cover for Rs.799 which is of good quality. Hoping to see more positive results for few more years !!!!! One star less for all the above negative points..."
113,2020-06-17,5,Go for it.,Don't get distracted by those bad reviews. This washing machine is value for money. The washing machine was delivered within 20 hrs of placing the order and the installation was done the very next day of the delivery. I don't understand why people keep on complaining that the installation is delayed. Maybe they should consider the fact that probably they themselves live in some remote area and should not expect everything expedited to their will.This machine is one of the best and does not deserve anything less than 5.
114,2020-10-22,5,Call Bosch for Installation,"No complaints about the machine. Installation was the problem. TVS-E was assigned to install and demo, but the date given was after 16 days of machine delivery !!!  So inquired with TVS team to expedite the installation date, but was refused due to date slot not available.Hene called Bosch service and directly booked for installation. Within 24 hrs Bosch technician came, installed and demoed in a professional manner.  Happy with Bosch service."
115,2020-06-27,3,Worst intake of water. Water intake is very poor.,"Waste of money. It does not take water in a proper way. In one and half bucket of water it washes 7kgs. Worst. There is no option to add more water. The clothes were stinking. They are not as perfect as we wash with hands. We use more water to clean the clothes perfectly. It doesn't matter how perfect the machine works, if it doesn't rinse properly in good amount of water then it's useless.  Clothes are not perfectly cleaned when it does not take more water. Also you don't have choice to rinse atleast 5-6 times. It does not take more water.  It does not rinse more number of times. It handly takes half bucket of water to rinse so many clothes, which just wets the clothes, forget about rinse."
116,2020-08-26,5,It is good and easy to use. Best one at this price.,"After seeing some negative comments I was in confusion whether to buy it in online or not, but then again after a lot of suggestions from my friends I have ordered it. Well, I am happy with the product. I am writing this review after using it for 1 month. And there are no complaints. Delivery was on time and even the installation too. Best one at this price and it is worth it. Don't think much. Go for it."
117,2022-08-04,1,Need replacement of Damage Bosch washing machine,"After Installation by Bosch technician on 8th July same day evening before use found damage in Detergent tray which replace on 14th July by Bosch service team. Due to summer vacation we start using this machine from 30th July. Same day Wife complained water in the floor from Washing machine  Technician surveys and informed 1st Aug evening , damage of a parts below the detergent tray. But there are not any external damage even scratches in the machine. As there are no response from Bosch again called them yesterday 3rd Aug and request them for replacement of damage washing machine. But the Concern Authorities Mr Rajdeep Gogoi refused to do so as we purchase from Amazon. But he assure me for repair service within warranty periods. Now my request to all Concern of Amazon and Bosch authorities  to replacement of this machine on urgent basis  enclosed  photographs of the machine with damage parts"
118,2020-11-13,5,Good,"Received Intact, no damage, excellent washing and a good product. Customer service team agreed for free installation. Call connect time is normally 7 to 8 minutes.  Installed within 24 hours on delivery,  believe me it is super fast. Although installation team too agreed but asked 150rs as unauthorised money without explanation. Please buy 3/4  to 1/2 coupling in advance. Kindly look into unauthorised charges as leaving brand image tarnished."

120,2020-07-29,5,Value for money,"Recently purchased this front loading washing machine 7kg. Worth the buy! No second thought if your budget is within 30K segment.* Very less Noise* No jerky feel* Less water consumptionNo complaints on machine.Only negative is regarding installation, people from bosh didn't even come after 4-5 days of wait, received 1st call on 5th day asking if he can guide me through call. Better watch installation video from bosh youtube channel and install it."
121,2022-02-14,5,Bought it for 24000,"Good for now lets see how it goes as we all know german thing lasts forever, I hope this will stand up to its reputation"
122,2020-09-26,5,Excellent product!!!,"excellent product, worth buying. use correct detergent and quality of cleaning is better.noise level is very low and super easy to use functions.i bought it last year but had to return as the product delivered was damaged during transportation however bought it again this year and everything was fine. took a few days for installation and demo as bosch is running short of manpower due to covid but at the end no complaints."
123,2019-10-09,5,Perfect Washing Machine for 4 member family.,"Bosch washing machine delivered on time by Amazon. Followed by installation &demo by Amazon service engineer. Everything was quick as usual by Amazon.Product is little overpriced compared to other brands available in the market.Product is ideally suited for 4 member family.It uses less water compared to top load. Noise level is bare minimum. Washes perfectly for each selected mode.  Best part of the machine one can choose RPM for wash. Quiet easy to use for everyone in the family. Accessories like stand & cover bit expensive from Bosch. For better longevity of the machine , do periodic drum cleaning, clean the inner drum with soft cloth after every wash to remove stains and bad odour."
124,2020-09-11,5,Bosch Washing Machine,"The 7kg Front-Loading Washing of Bosch is a good value for the money. Silent and efficient both on low water consumption and energy.Due to COVID19 restriction, the installation took place after 16 days after it was delivered that to after a lot of follow-ups. the Call Center could be more responsive if they plan out the installation schedule and communicate the same to the customer instead of the customer having to escalate the request."
125,2020-01-15,4,"Value for Money and Many options , quality product","Great product , with good options to select , temperature settings available for cotton clothes 40/60 deg c, No pre wash available in this model, this options is available in next model with addl. Cost .Less noise and vibration, recommended to buy the stand sold separately by Bosch.Installation is done by skilled technician, didn't demand extra money."
126,2020-11-15,5,Worth buying!!,"The product is good. The quality of the cloths remains intact after washing. Spinning quality is also good. This particular model has a 15 min quick wash program which is very helpful and useful for daily laundries. Even though this is a front loading washing machine, it is still gets fit into small space. Overall as of now after 2 months of use we are satisfied with the product."
127,2021-08-17,5,It's a good buy,"I bought this 3 weeks back. Delivery was quick, I got it next day. Bosch installation was done withinn next 3 days. I had to fit steel tap and 16v power plug as it will not fit in normal power plug. Machine is working fine as of now."
128,2019-11-04,4,Good,Low noise. Good space inside.Excellent wash quality up to 70% load. Faster delivery than commited.But no installation. Someone called me and said I will be called again when they arrange a person for my location.After 9 days I called local technician and got it installed.I also find that a warranty card is missing. May be the bill could be enough.
129,2020-07-29,5,Excellent,"This is one of the best performing washing machines in the industry. I have experienced using LG, Samsung washing machines. But this Bosch washing machine is at a different level. The build quality is everlasting. Performance is phenomenal. Power and water consumption is half of any top loading washing machine and the wash quality is excellent. So, don't blindly compare the price and conclude that it is costly. It is definitely value for money in the long run."
130,2022-06-04,5,Very good,Like
131,2022-04-21,5,Better Washing Machine,I like this product. It is good and can be recommended.
132,2018-03-03,4,The product is very good..,"The product is very good... have been using for past 4 - 5 months. But guys be prepared for spending for all the additional stuffs need for Installation, compared to other washing machines all the additional installation stuffs are expensive eg, the outlet pipe, drum cleaning powder etc all are more expensive than other washing machines. Also please do not go by actual spec give the machine work in normal water pressure as well, you might not need an additional booster pump, which again costed me about 6K and as of now no use, because the machine works fine in normal water pressure. This is just from my experience, may vary for other."
133,2020-12-14,5,"Best WM, Easy to use , Low noise level , value for money üí∏","Washing machine is very good , 100 percentage value for money . I brought this washing machine in Diwali sell . For 27990/-. Easy to use. I searched a lot but this washing machine is best . Not low , this washing have no Maintaince . Extremely easy to use. This washing machine comes with so many modes. As per our need we can use the modes. Noise level is low as possible . Bosch is very good company."
134,2020-02-21,4,Superb wash quality.,This is my first washing machine and I wasn't sure about my decision. But Bosch washing machine has proven that German brands are trust-able. Washing machine works silently and wash quality is good. Also I observe that it uses less water but still wash quality is awesome. You can go for this washing machine.
135,2020-08-09,5,Low noise machine from Bosch,"We brought this machine in Oct 2018, after using for 2 years, I am writing a review, the machine is working absolutely fine with low noise, you need to go near the machine to check whether it is ON or not , before we were using IFB se√±orita plus which used to make lot of noise like generator and used to move 1 to 2 feet from its original place, I highly recommend this product"
136,2021-02-06,4,Bosch,Everything is ok but the customer service is not up to the mark and the people who came for demo are not doing the installation process completely... service from Bosch is very disappointing..
137,2021-09-04,5,Review after 4 year of use.....,I hv order in Sept 2017 now given review after 4 year of use.. I have ordered 2 machine 6 & 7 kg both.Honestly Bosch Nice work done...Very Useful for daily Laundry.Less time & electricity consuming.. Affordable to use for everyone...
138,2022-02-18,5,This BOSCH product offers best washing quality I have seen in a front load washing machine. 5 star,"Best washing quality, low power, water and detergent consumption. Almost noise free operation. Study build quality and no vibration in body."
139,2018-07-01,5,It's an awesome machine!!,"Writing this review after usages of 3-4 weeks, 2-3 wash Cycles. I was little skepticle of purchasing a Bosch washing machine from the customer service and installation point of views. Though I was sure of quality of machine.But I got this machine installed in two days of delivery as promised. Technician installed is as per our requirements. I had to purchase a connector for my normal tap which cost me 350/- bucks.Coming to wash quality, it's just awesome!!! I couldn't expect any better than this.Noise level is almost nil, you can peacefully sleep when your machine does a laundry .. some sound in rinse cycle which is anticipated as machine runs on full RPM for rinsing.At this stage fully satisfied with this purchase. Thanks to Amazon for nice delivery as well on schedule.."
140,2019-10-06,5,"Product perfect , amazon installation service pathetic","I would like to give 5 rating to product and negative rating to amazon installation service due to below reasons:1.Installation executive comes with zero knowledge of washing machine2.He didn't remove the locks nor he set the machine at same levelNow when i started machine, it started vibrating and running on the floor.I immediately switched it off and called Bosch and as expected Customer care guy immediately set up a service request .Bosch executive identified the problem saying that the installation has not been done properly and installed the machine by removing locks from the machine again.Now its running fine and i have 5star just because of the product."
141,2022-02-06,5,Very Good & Satisfied,"I liked it after using 15days, thanks a ton for this good product Bosch. Soundless and great satisfaction to me and my familyüëç"
142,2021-05-26,3,Makes huge sound and not that good has LG washing machine,It's makes huge sound and i have been like 8months nearly if you open the door and want to add extra laundry we are getting shock if we don't switch of the main power overall not satisfactory we used LG washing machine since 15years its very good comparitively and service engineer also does no much information of the product during the installation and visit time.
143,2020-12-18,5,Really good,"I am using this product for the past 2 months. I am a happy customer so far. All dresses are getting washed properly and even the tough stains are getting removed. Noise levels are low. Also, the packaging was good and delivered on time. Within a day Bosch arranged the demo and installation. So definitely worth buying and I strongly recommend it"
144,2020-03-06,5,Super Purchase... Satisfied!,"Purchased in November 2019. Using daily for regular laundry.Very Useful Machine having very Low noise.. My 1 Year son's sleep never got Disturbed.. All kinds of Rugs, Blankets and chaddars could be washed Easily and Very much cleaned. We used Henko matic detergent powder for washing which is too good than other renowned and expensive branded powder. This machine having child lock feature, time schedule feature of 24 hours, functions in low water pressure as well as with less water consumption, using very less power for light loads or with normal temperature."
145,2016-09-07,4,German quality Indian Made!! A truely winning combination indeed ‚ò∫‚ò∫,"I bought thus machine one month ago, and using this daily. It is really a great machine, the motor is super silent and zero vibration while washing and rinsing.The machine was delivered right on time and contrary to other posts here, the customer support was lightning fast. The person came on time, provided suggestions where to put it properly and provided a complete demo. He was polite and courteous. Provided maintenance tous and how to take care of the machine.The machine has some very often used programs and cleans cloth properly. We just need to do proper maintenance and it will keep chugging along.A solid machine with performance at great price !!"
146,2022-02-23,5,Bosch machine is value for money product.,Product is very good.noise level is low. Bosch service only in big city. Small city have no service
147,2015-09-20,5,Bosch 7Kg fully automatic W/M,"Hello,I bought Bosch fully automatic W/M last weekend. Initially I was apprehensive purchasing high value & Bulky item like W/M on Amazon considering the probable damage during delivery, installation, demo and issues related to warranty. But amazon, Bosch and Viveks (from where product was physically shipped) team really pleasantly surprised me with their prompt delivery and after delivery services by Bosch & Viveks.Product was delivered within 15 hrs of order placement! Within next two days product was commissioned.The W/M performance is excellent considering very less water consumption compared to my earlier one, very low noise, cleanliness of the clothes without any damage, etc.Further all manufacturer's warranty is covered for motor and body and one need not have to worry about it. I am stressing this as one of the retailers was telling me that manufacturer's warranty is not covered if W/M is bought online.Over all I am very happy with the product and strongly recommend to buy it through amazon."
148,2017-12-13,5,Happy with my decision...,"I have bought the Bosch WAK24168IN, 7Kg model last week. The installation and demo from the Bosch technical team was very prompt and professional. The technician came on time and the interaction was very professional. He unpacked the machine carefully and explained all details. The demo was very detailed and also explained how to maintain it by proper cleaning of compartments, filters etc.I liked the machine for the simple user interface and optimal options it has got. It is performing good. It cleans the cloths really well, compared to my previous machine which was IFB Senorita.I loved the compact design with anti-vibration. I can say there is not noise at all.The features i liked are no anti-vibration, reload option, delayed start, active water  and 15 mins quick wash.The included filter is a normal filter not a water softener."
149,2019-08-17,4,Excellent wash but dryer could've been better!!!,"This Bosch WAK24168IN fully automatic washing m/c is very functional. Easy to use, nearly noiseless and cleans very well.  However, the dryer could've been better. There is some uneven drying after wash and the drying temperature could've been higher to deliver near complete dry laundry.  There should have been a separate ""dry only"" functionality.For this price, that's what customers would want."
150,2019-01-19,5,Simply Excellent Bosch,"Thanks to Amazon for the trust and quality, bought it and was delivered on time without any issues or damages. But only thing I didnt like was the executive who came for installation, charged me 400 for 3mtr pipe whereas it was around 180-200 in the market. Please be careful with those executives, they are the best salespersons.Coming to the washing machine, already tried washing to the full extent, but simply amazing wash quality. Fair bit of difference btwn top and front load. On the down side, the machine is very heavy and cannot be moved by a single person. Advise you to take a trolley stand once Product is ordered. No issues as far as Washing Machine is concerned 5 Star rating."
151,2019-09-29,4,Delivery is poor,product is good. delivery boys were hesitant to pick the product to work area. since it is front load weight is humoungous. and my old mother was alone in the house. after arguing they droped it my work area. installation takes 2 days after delivery. But product is good. dont look for 2k extra just buy household things from flipkart.
152,2018-12-01,4,Perfect wash and low vibrations.,"Here are some points, I liked about this washing machine.1. Bosch service is excellent. They came for installation on the same day of delivery.2. Very low noise during running.3. It will clean collar stains. Wash is good( we used normal detergent not specific for front load)4. Can load in between the cycle.5. Aesthetics is good.Overall a good buy for Rs. 23999/- (Also got Rs. 1000/- cash back on Amazon Pay)."
153,2020-01-27,5,Amazon installation is waste,"The Washing machine is good. But for installation, i would recommend you to wait for the company person to do it. If you request installation from Amazon, they do not do it properly. My washing machine was installed my Amazon service and it started to give problems (the machine vibrated a lot and was moving when ON due to vibration) later we camplained to Bosch and they said installation was not done correctly. After Bosch got it set, there is no problem till now (for more than a year)."
154,2020-08-15,5,"No vibration, no noise, best performance","Design is very good. Machine works silently, you do not feel any disturbing sound or vibration. A little bit vibration/noise feel only at the time of spin only, but it is also not disturbing sound. Fully satisfied with product. But you can buy 8kg series 6 (this is series 4 model) also with extra spending of Rs.1500. Please do full comparison of models from flipkart also before order."
155,2019-12-05,5,Wonderful delivery & installation experience,I got Bosch washing machine on great offer from Amazon. The machine got delivered in less than 24 hours. Bosch technician came within a day to install the machine. I think Bosch is a great machine which does not require any different opinion. But what is the difference here is the efficient service of delivery and installation done jointly by Amazon and Bosch. And they had a seamless interaction with with other which was very good considering the fact both are two separate entities. This made the entire process of delivery and installation with no tension.
156,2015-08-16,5,I have had an excellent experience. Starting from the prompt acknowledgement from Amazon ...,"I was very apprehensive about ordering a washing machine online. It was actually the biggest thing (in size and volume) I had ordered through any e-commerce site. Once I placed the order with Amazon, I have had an excellent experience. Starting from the prompt acknowledgement from Amazon to the regular follow-up from the Amazon customer service team regarding the status of my order to answering all my questions regarding the technical requirements of Bosch, Amazon took complete ownership to ensure I had a pleasant experience till the item was delivered to my address. I will certainly recommend this to any of you who may be considering such purchases in the future.About the product - I am 100% satisfied. Ease of installation, Warranty (the motor has an amazing 10 year warranty), Features, Power consumption and Performance - this washing machine scores very high on all parameters. Anyone in the family, I mean anyone can easily use this machine."
157,2018-11-18,5,Great Service and Product,MachineWorks really well as it is being used almost everyday for past 2 weeks with no issuesvery low noisegood cleaning as my mothers standards are high and she is happyThe pipe fitting etc was very smooth even with the filter attachedService:After reading reviews for Service i still thought to go ahead with this machine as the reviews were good.I am in Nagpur so i was worried about the installation might take time.To my surprise the delivery was timely and the installation was done next day.The service man did not sell anything extra and was politeNo headache what so ever and nice awesome performance.
158,2021-09-09,4,"Easy,quick and neat wash","Product is good. Easy, quick and neat wash"
159,2019-09-05,5,Value for Money,"I am using this machine since last 11 month without any problem. I have washed every type of cloths, curtains, foot mats, sofa cushions, Bedsheets, blankets single and double bed also, WOOLen sweater, and Jackets, Track Suits, sports, and washable shoes, which ealrlier I suppose to give in the laundry Only Silk has to take care about RPM. Many and easy functions. No extra sound it makes nice sound resembling like Travelling in  AIRCRAFT. Much more to tell all but in short it is value for money, time-saving, detergent saving at last wife mood saving for day to day happy life."
160,2021-05-26,5,It's really amazing,"Really I like this product..Very easy to use.Worth of money.Less noise.I Fully satisfied with Bosch.. because in this there awesome option like RPM setting 600-1200, temperature setting 80-20 & alaram also..If anybody planning to buy, I requested to choose this product.."
161,2020-06-01,5,"Bosch 7 kg Fully-Automatic Front Loading Washing Machine (WAK24168IN, Silver, Inbuilt Heater)",Overall the product is super in terms of Quality. I recommend this product as 5 star. But the only issue is here with this product is you cannot tie the drain pipe and water inlet pipe after the use. You need to entangle somewhere or leave it like that only. When you compare with other washing machine you can tie up the drain pipe and inlet pipe. But in this its not possible.
162,2018-03-07,5,Excellent product,"I have been using it for 1 week only but still it's a fabulous product. The delivery was done next day and installation took 2 working days (delivery on Saturday and installation on Tuesday). There was no issues with the installation, the technician was very polite and gave proper demo. You might have to spend 300/- for tap adapter as mentioned in other reviews, I ended up buying one cover as well. Stand is not recommended with the machine.I have done some 2-3 wash and the wash is very clean (it ended up removing holi colors from one of my t-shirt). The machine is super silent and you will not notice it running unless you are standing next to it. Overall worth the money spent."
163,2020-12-07,4,"Good product, easy to use but takes time to wash.","It is easy to use, cleans clothes well. Not much noise, value for money. But it takes 2 hrs for 7kg wash, which is on the higher side. Overall good product."
164,2019-09-08,5,Go for it Tiger!,"What more can I ask once I ordered Bosch product. Reliable, ethical, sauve, advanced, superb, sensible and above all bang on for value for money. This machine is awesome in delivering precise washing quality with ease and practically no involvement at all except for loading clothes and the liquid detergent. It works in Ninja mode and consumes less water to deliver flawless cleanliness. Will different operative modes available, it makes the work even more easy. I am happy and satisfied for having made the right choice as always with all my purchases from Amazon. Long live Bosch."
165,2022-03-10,5,Superb product,Every one should buy this and get genuine experience üòÖ
166,2017-10-20,4,Machine is good,"Got it delivered on time, installation took almost 5 days :(Machine has very good build quality, makes very less noise while washing , a lil during spinning.Water pipe is short, had to buy adapter (extra pipe for 550 from installation guy) + inlet for tap (again 350 bucks more).Seemed like installation guy is running his own business on top of installation demo. He even offered washing machine cover for 850 and electrical fitting ( he has electrician friend as well )Overall good experience with Amazon and Bosch ."
167,2020-11-28,5,"Jack of many, at a good price","Jack of many at a reasonable price. 3 options of temperature for cotton cloaths, rest are preprogrammed. Choice to change the RPM, have an additional water iteration are plus. RO water filter is part of the package. Delay in starting the wash works as soaking option. All this at a very reasonable price with German technology. Highly recommended."
168,2018-10-28,4,Very worthy to buy this model,"Wash quality is fantastic and the service guy who came for installation was too good and explained different modes clearly. I have bought stand, cover & desclaer from him, it's better to buy the Bosch stand, bit costlier but worthy. This is one star is less because Amazon didn't placed installation request until I give a call for them to do so otherwise delivery, installation & importantly washing machine quality everything superb."
169,2022-01-30,5,Just go for BOSCH!,"Blindly go for BOSCH washing machine. Excellent product, high quality standards. Every house must have this silent washer."
170,2015-10-11,5,I recommend this product,"I'm using this machine from last 6 months and no problem at all. Purchased in April 2015 with very competitive price from Amazon (I tried a lot to get this product from Bosch Employee Program from my friend but found that Amazon is selling even cheaper).I liked -1. The best cleaning quality (Can never be achieved with hand wash).2. Less electricity consumption. Not seen much increase in electricity bill - we run almost everyday this machine.3. DIY troubleshooting - Once machine stopped working and it was indicating the error code (E16 or something), I read the manual and it was saying inlet water filter/pipe needs to clean. Cleaned the filter and machine started working. Impressive!!!4. Very less noise and vibration.One can buy this product blindly - I recommend this product. Very good product. Good job by Bosch and Amazon."
171,2020-07-07,5,Dont think to much just buy it,The machine is fabulous it cleans clothes and keeps them in good condition doesn't damage the clothes where as other machines do it while washing them the installation process is really very simple but when you order the machine you have to buy a small adaptor which connects to your water line a small thing but creates a big issue other wise the machine is seriously amazing
172,2016-10-07,5,Super service by Amazon & Bosch,"As usual Amazon service is wowüòä. Then I would like to saw about the product  as per others review I accept it is very nice product. Mainly I would like to say about the installation, in most of the reviews they told about worst service by Bosch I will not accept it. I received the product on 5th oct evening by 4.30 immediately I request for the installation, 6th morning by 10.30 I received call from service centre and told me that service Engineer will call , what a surprise by 11.15 I got a call from engineer and he ask my appointment and I ask him to come today evening by 5(7th oct) and I totally forgot but today afternoon by 2 he call me and remind me abt the appointment and installation done today ."
173,2020-10-04,4,Best product,"The product is good , despite the service , he never listened to me , well was unhappy with the service but the product is a monster , works worth the money ."
174,2020-07-29,4,Good working.. but No proper customer service,I use from 9 months.. Good results and performance..I contact to service man 2 to 3 time but not as friendly as others..Service man take money however there is no issue bill or anything else....
175,2022-02-06,5,Bought Two machines back to back,Product is good and worth with multiple selection. Bought two machine back to back
176,2020-07-13,5,Good purchase,"Delivery was prompt, followed by installation by Bosch engineer. I got it delivered in 2 days and next day of delivery Bosch engineer visited my place and did the installation. Water input hose length is only 140CM so I paid 450 for extension hose which was available with Bosch engineer.Noise level is very low. It's just a week so can't comment on any issues."
177,2022-10-26,1,Has too much vibration and vobble. My old lg washing m/c working very smooth and noiseless.,Has too much vibration and vobble. My old lg washing m/c working very smooth and noiseless. Tried machine with stand and w/o stand but results same. Does all Bosch m/c works in same pattern or my particular m/c is faulty. What i suggest is center of gravity of drum is bit on higher side
178,2019-03-05,4,"Stylish washing machine, worked well so far","The machine looks good and the installation by bosch was seamless.We've been using the machine for several months now and it's been working fine. We haven't reached out to Bosch customer care for any issues and that'll be something that might disappoint us. But to give Bosch advantage of doubt, it's all nice till now.I recommend this product."
179,2020-07-25,5,Good but still not received warranty,The product is good however I have marked down on value for money because the after sales care is pathetic. One month after delivery and many calls/emails to Bosch we are still waiting for the warranty and the technician to come for a demo.  Would suggest going for a brand with known good after care even if you have to pay a little more
180,2017-10-06,5,Good product !! Worst delivery,"product is very good, washes and cleans the clothes very well no sound while spin is running but the delivery through blue dart was very worst first time sent back the delivery guys because they failed to deliver as only 2 members were not able to carry the product then second time same happened but  we only helped those guys and got the product delivered our-self simply amazon gives show off by telling door step deliver so dear friends i prefer not the purchase the product in amazon its better to purchase in outlet itself. instillation got done very quickly on the same day the product got delivered and machine is worth the value you pay."
181,2017-04-20,5,A funtastic product,"After a thorough search for a good quality front loading washing machine, we finally decided to buy Bosch.Delivery from Amazon was quick and efficient. Bosch's customer support however was the complete opposite. It took almost a week to get the machine installed, (amazon came to the rescue here as well). The installation itself was quick and hassle free. The technician had a commanding knowledge and explained each and every function in detail.It has been five months since the purchase, and the machine is working excellently.The functions are extremely easy to use. I have been particularly impressed by how silently the machine works. The RPM function comes in very handy for clothes which need a gentle wash cycle. All in all a five star product."
182,2020-11-16,5,The fitting and demonstration of the machine is very good. The service is excellent.,I am buying an expensive product online for the first time.  It's been 4 days since we started using it.  I got it at 27990 / - which is my favorite. The best thing is that the clothes look clean and new. The fitting and demonstration of the machine is very good. The service is excellent.
183,2018-08-14,4,Installation,"Machine work superb no sound no vibration clothes come super clean. Amazon is best in delivering products. But I can't understand this Bosch service guy literally looting people no response I have to follow up for installation he sold me water inlet pipe for 500 without bill ,which is 300 online.  Even seeing so much of bad reviews of service people why they are not taking any action. Still not convinced with service of Bosch.  But overall machine is good"
184,2022-04-06,5,Good,Good excellent
185,2022-02-10,5,Amazon delivery on time good service  & Bosch service also very good,Amazon delivery on time & Bosch service also very good
186,2021-02-06,4,Nice washing. No issues,"Good one! Not a lot of noise. Works well without any stand. Don't use any stand, it make the machine vobble a lot."
187,2022-01-19,5,good product,writing this review after using for around 1 month. it's working fine . Excellent product
188,2020-10-19,5,SOO FARR ..GREAT....!!!,Was a bit doubtful whether will it be as good as the Old model .....i think i am the first one to oreder this model and was very anxious how will it turn out .....Got a great offer got it for around 26k ....Very happy with the experience so far......Will post detailed experience after spending some time with the machine
189,2022-02-20,5,The quite beast,Very quiet. You can hear water splashing
190,2018-06-29,4,Machine is excellent. Service part needs to be improved. Front load saves water. Useful wash options available.,"1. Time of installation Bosch will ask for an adaptor to be fitted for the water inlet at the water tap end. Amazon cost of that adaptor is Rs.170/-. Bosch franchise person who came for demo and installation asked for Rs.300/-.2. They do not follow guidelines such as levelling of the machine, checking of earthing, etc.3. They of course try to sell stand and plastic cover for the machine. One can get better deals on Amazon.4. Additionally, water softener can be purchased. You can easily fix it without any help. I had ordered from Water Science on Amazon. My neighbour was sold a water softener of another brand by the service person at double the price mentioned on Amazon. Anyways, none of the water softeners have good feedback on Amazon. Just to be on safer side.5. The franchisee offering customer service offered 2 year extra warrenty (2 years anyways Bosch provides) i.e.at Rs.3500/-. Without this maintenance contract, they would be charging Rs.800/- per visit even during company warranty period. There are online warrenty seller such as Bharati and Onsite. I am yet to compare the options."
191,2017-10-10,4,"very good, silent but there is one down side","very good, silent but there is one down side. I have used IFB for 11 years. They cover everything in Annual maintenance contract. Bosch does not, plastic and rubber parts are excluded. Besides IFB and LG give you 4 years full warranty upfront. For Bosch you will have to spend more money to extend warranty. I bought this but realised LG was a better option with direct drive and 4 years upfront warranty. If you still want to buy this go for the newer model."
192,2021-05-16,5,"Good product, I'm happy","I'm giving review after 22 days of purchasing, it's good working and same as told by company.But my area is facing low electric power supply so it needs a voltage steplizer, I suggest use it with voltage steplizer for best performance."
193,2020-11-01,5,Excellent product,I am writing this revuew after one month of use. Nice product and completely value for money. There was some vibartion noise when running machine at 1200rpm but then i called amazon and they assigned a service engineer. He did the leveling again and the vibartion issue was solved. Wash quality is quite good.
194,2022-01-19,5,Low noise level when using,"Quality is very good, running noise of washing machine is very less"
195,2020-01-16,4,Good product,"So far so good, it's been 2 weeks since operating the machine. There is a considerable amount of sound and it's not totally silent in its operation. The options provided are sufficient enough for any kind of washing & the built is very tough."
196,2019-08-11,4,Seems very good,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†So far so good. Installation was easy. Have to put a filter (see pic, video). Water pressure won't be a problem for most places, but some people might have to instal a pressure pump. Will post an update about how it cleans clothes but should be good because it follows the tumble or dhobi pachad method. Have to use front load detergent for best results and machine fitness."
197,2020-12-06,5,Top one among front loading washing machines.,"Prior to this (Bosch 7kg Front loading), we were using another front loader of different (very famous) make and we suffered with all aspects of that washing machine. The present one is 100 times better than the old one, in all aspects such as noise, vibration, usage of water, ease of use etc."
198,2017-12-20,4,Need proper inlet pipe,The washing machine doesn't come with a proper inlet pipe as it's very short in length and not suited for taps. I had to pay 650 Rs extra to get a inlet pipe from the service engineer. This is a known problem and highlighted in many reviews before. Bosch should provide a proper inlet pipe with the product for its indian customers. I bought this as amazon was giving a good deal and overall Happy with the product.
199,2017-10-19,5,Spartan of the machines,"Super, fantastic, excellent.If you have not used then you will never understand this machine. This is called class apart from crowd. I have never ever seen a washing machine Wash clothes so perfectly without any noise or damage to your clothes. You will just fall in love with this machine. It's a heavy weight, less noise, no vibration, cool machine. I washed daily clothes, bedsheets, blanket, jeans and lot of clothes in this machine, it gives better cleaning than hand. Only suggestion is that use only matic powder for better result. It's spinning dry clothes to 80-90% which is higher than any machine. One word - Spartan."
200,2020-12-14,4,Economy in clothes washing.,I find that this machine consumes less detergent and water. It does not require extra plumbing to pump out used water.A good buy.
201,2020-07-02,5,Value for Money!,"I got the best deal in diwali. Talking about this Washing machine, Name is enough to show its potential. ""Bosch"".  Noise level could have been better but apart from that it's damm powerful. Automatic Warm water facilities helps a lot. Extra detachable nozzle for cleaning is a big help. RPM is so good as compared to Samsung and LG. Go for it."
202,2020-10-30,3,Missed Parts ; no replacement; only refund;,"I got the product as expected but unfortunately packing missed many parts so I was asked to return, could not provided the replacement, ended with refund. It‚Äôs embarrassing as product is returned from home. Very bad, I don‚Äôt know whose problem. So guys be cautious. I am planning to buy another now. I lost time here."
203,2017-10-05,4,Machine rocks but service(delivery/demo) will not happen until you yourself followup,Order Delivery  waiting time 3 star.Demo and instalation 2 star they just force us to use the tap adapter and they sell it for 350rs.They don't come until you yourself followupBosch 7kg washing machine will give 5 starThe machine is absolutely fabulous but suggest you to take a Solid stand for it to avoid it from rust and a cover to maintain its richness colour and shine.  Rest the machine is perfect.
204,2021-07-07,5,Bosch the boss,A must buy for all looking for a perfect washing machine. Zero sound and a lit experience if you are looking for comparison between other brands like lg and samsung buy a bosch..its really the boss
205,2016-03-14,5,Remember to level the washing machine. After understanding the ...,"Remember to level the washing machine. After understanding the cantilever design it occured to me that it should be levelled using the spirit-level. Sadly, the Bosch installation personnel had not bothered to level it. I've given 5-star rating notwithstanding the lapse. I read the manual to find that Bosch warranty is void if the washing is operated without levelling. So, when I received a call from Bosch I complained about it. The complaint was escalated to a senior and the conversation with him revealed that the warranty is also void if the washing machine is kept on a stand. Although it came as a shock, it was not hard to see the point that machine is designed to rest on solid static surface in order to operate safely at 1200 RPM."
206,2022-01-08,5,Bosch Is Boss,Literally BOSCH name should be BOSS.. awesome & very good machine
207,2020-11-26,3,Good machine but poorly installed,Machine is good but the engineer who came to install it and connect the pipeline did a very shoddy job...its been 3 times that we have had to call local plumber as the connector with the pipe doesnt stick on to tap for too long...
208,2020-10-19,4,Machin looks good but Amazon delivery was worst,Not happy with the delivery.Delivery boy just delivered it near the buildingHave to bring the washing machin to 1st floor on my own.
209,2017-08-14,5,Working great as per the company claims,"Using since last 3 months. Working great as per the company claims. Washing is really good I didn't saw before with other washing machines, semi(s) or auto.- Very less use of water (other automatic machine usually drain out you water tanks)- Almost zero vibration- Very easy to install- Demo guy gave me brief but I learned it by reading its manual, very easy.- Installation guy came after 48 hours.- Very easy to operateI usually do lot of search/research before to go for any product. It took me nearly a week to finalise this machine. And now I'm quiet happy with the product."
210,2021-06-30,5,Excellent quality!,I've been using this washing machine for a year now. I recommend it to.my neighbour & he bought one too. Does a fantastic job & makes considerably lesser noise than my previous LG washing machine.
211,2019-10-06,4,Ok,Service center is useless. You have to repeatedly call the service center for installation. Also the service person doesn‚Äôt have proper tools like level meter to set the machine properly. I have read the instructions on manuals but they don‚Äôt follow the rules while installing the machine.
212,2017-07-12,5,Good wash/dry performance with 1200 rpm motor,"The 1200 rpm motor on this machine makes quite a difference - clothes come out close to dry. The wash quality has been good too.The only difference between this and the 24268 is (a) the 24268 has a larger display, and (b) the 24268 has an option to independently control temperature irrespective of the wash program chosen. Since the wash programs are thoughtfully chosen for Indian conditions, we have never felt the need to fiddle with individual settings (such as rpm and time, which is allowed by the 24168 also). So I'd recommend saving the cash and going for the 24168 instead of the 24268."
213,2020-12-01,4,This is perfect,We tried a top load at my village it didn't work. With this the water pressure and wash quality is good.
214,2018-07-05,5,Product is very nice but think about the service too,"Product is nice however it was a big challenge to get the installation done...As committed, after buying the machibe within 48 hrs installation team will connect with us and come for demo however in our case even after 48 hrs we were literally chasing the Bosch team to come for installation.Bosch team were blaming Amazon team for thr delay & Amazon team was blaming Bosch, ultimately 'We' were at the receiving end. Bad service.The executive was also in much hurry to close the demo and leave."
215,2018-09-25,5,Amazing washing machine from Amazon by BOSCH,"A very good washing machine.Many salient and useful features.Different wash settings for various types of clothes.Load it, set it, switch it and forget it.For next one hour or so you attend to other work or simply relax.Though you may feel the price is on a higher side at about 25K , it's a full automatic washing machine with fully loaded useful features.Customer friendly installation  and timely delivery made this purchase a pleasant experience for me.Thanks to Amazon and Bosch."
216,2020-10-29,1,Pathetic Amazon service,"This review is not about the product. It's about Amazon's rigid rules and bad service. The product was delivered 2 days after order. But the nightmare had just started. The delivery of this 71 kg medicine was done at doorstep while it was needed on the first floor. In my absence the women had to argue and convince the delivery guys. They finally delivered and were paid for the""help"", though they didn't ask for it. Next came the installation and the technician couldn't install the machine as the inlet pipe shipped with the machine had threading issues and wouldn't couple with the adaptor. The technician repacked the product and told me it would be replaced. While i got a mail the same day, Amazon didn't initiate a replacement till i followed up the next day. The replacement timeline was 2 weeks. So i was now left with a package to safeguard for 2 weeks and it occupied space. I had no alternate means to wash clothes. All this because an inlet pipe was faulty and as per process it cant be replaced and the entire package has to be replaced. After waiting for a week i finally decided to take things into my own hands and reached out to the Bosch customer care. Convinced them it was a win win situation and got the inlet pipe replaced and the machine installed. Summary Amazon is fine for smaller items definitely not for items like these."
217,2021-07-16,4,Worth for money,Very good
218,2020-10-03,3,No post installation support from Bosch,The Bosch service centre scheduled my appointment two times but no technician up for installation and demo. I had to hire a washing machine service person for that purpose and spent additional money for something that should be free of cost. There is lots to improve Bosch team.
219,2019-05-16,4,A beast comes at a price!,"Got this for my mom and she's pretty happy with the product. What we didn't really like was that installation took time. There was no proactive call from the company and I had to follow up with them to get it scheduled. But once spoken, those guys were prompt with installation."
220,2016-05-17,4,Bosch WAK24168IN Review,Amazon delivery was very much satisfactory. I got this product from Hyderabad though my delivery location was Bangalore after i raised a concern with Amazon. Product is very good. Have been using it for a month. Cleans effectively with very less water and electricity. But was not satisfied with the Bosch Support. The installation guy charged extra for the additional hose and adopter and took Rs. 650. I heard that installation is free for other washing machine brands even when additional hose is required. Was highly disappointed with this. Hence reduced a star.
221,2021-07-10,4,Value for money,Good product
222,2020-08-15,4,Installation is delayed beyond limit,It's been 7 days and no one has come for installation of the machine. Pathetic service by Bosch...Sad to see this from a world renowned company.
223,2018-10-23,5,Quality product from Bosch,"This is best washing machine I must say. silent and clean operation and clothes come out super clean .I bought it for 25k but in sale it was for 22k ,guys if you thinking for fully automatic washing machine then this machine has everything you need .Don't get confused between if,lgor other brand , this is one of the quality product and u will not disappoint at all . I am using it for a month now and satsfied with purchase"
224,2019-09-08,4,Value for money !!,Purchased Bosch WAK24168IN/07 7kg.Very compatible appliance & satisfactory performance as claimed. It's easy to use and value for money. Cost competitive at 28 K.Amazon delivery schedule is excellent but disappointed with Bosch service as they took more than one week for demo and installation.
225,2020-11-14,4,Good performance,Good easy to use. Washing is good. 90 percent dry. But noise level is a bit high. Value for money
226,2020-12-03,4,Three legs are missing in package for washing machine,"Washing machine legs are not provided.Only one leg is available in package, another three legs are not available."
227,2017-01-27,5,Brilliant machine! Needs good water pressure.,"This is a totally brilliant washing machine. Super quiet, super sleek and the clothes come out super clean.The Bosch installation guys are also very professional. No complaints at all.One thing that most reviews don't talk about is the heated washing function. It washes at 60 degrees and clothes come out even more clean!One small negative: good water pressure is a must. If your water pressure is low be sure you'll get the dreaded E17 error. I got a pressure pump installed specifically for the machine. If your overhead tank is about two floors above you, that should be enough. If not, get a pressure pump."
228,2020-09-07,5,Must buy,"The machine is very sturdy and no need for the stand but cover is must to protect from dust,water and corrosion. You need to have washing machine tap which is easily available in local market along with adapter which fits into washing machine inlet.The delivery, packing and installation was very good"
229,2021-05-03,4,Worth the cost!!!!,Amazingly silent in comparison to IFB Washing Machine... Truly impressed
230,2020-12-04,4,Better price at 25k,Overall performance was good and while getting end of wash it noise heavily and vibrating remaining all good
231,2017-10-23,5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT. RECEIVED THE MACHINE ON TIME,"EXCELLENT PRODUCT. RECEIVED THE MACHINE ON TIME. WAS APPREHENSIVE OF THE INSTALLATION DELAYS FROM THE COMPANY AFTER READING REVIEWS. BUT THE RESPONSE FROM AMAZON AND THE BOSCH REP WERE EXCELLENT AND ALL ACTIONS HAPPENED WITHIN THE TIMELINES WITHOUT ANY NEED FOR A CALL FROM MY SIDE. THE MACHINE ITSELF IS WONDERFUL WITH EXCELLENT WASHING EXPERIENCE AND ZERO SOUND AS AGAINST MY OLDER MACHINE WHICH USED TO KEEP US AWAKE AT NIGHT. SIMPLE MENUS AND UNLESS U NEED TO DO RESEARCH ON WASHING MACHINES, THE MENUS IS ENOUGH FOR HOUSE HOLD USE. EXCELLENT MACHINE REALLY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT."
232,2021-02-03,4,East to use,It been more than a month and it's running just fine. Easy to use.
233,2022-12-01,1,Machine found faulty within one month only,Amazon supply faulty machine damage within one month only
234,2019-10-29,4,"Good appliance, installation is bad","Good easy of use, great value for money. However installation is bad, they sent single technician with disabled, how can he lift and install that heavy weight appliance, we helped them to install temporarily later we called plumber to fix permanently."

240,2020-08-09,4,Good product,Thank you Bosch and Amazon for giving such kind of products and services but little disappointed with small dent at right corner side
241,2020-09-10,3,Good but not for intense stains,Pros:noise level is almost zeroWater usage is too optimalMany wash modes to take care of clothesCons:Children cloths won‚Äôt be cleaned properly even in kids mode.Sticky stains won‚Äôt clean ( using surf excel powder)Sometimes vibrates too fast
242,2020-10-27,4,Easy to use but little bit noisy too,bosch installation service is good. Machine is little bit noisy instead this all performance of machine is good
243,2020-01-12,4,"Great machine, pleased with the service.","I had an issue in the very first week, but Bosh customer service in Hyderabad resolved it in reasonable time. I bought this machine for my parents, they are now very happy with the product."
244,2017-04-28,5,Very useful tool at home and the best gift to yourself or your family,I have used this product for a year now. There is no trouble what so ever till date. The installation was smooth and the technician came right the next day of booking an installation. There are no additional costs for installation. The only cost would be a suitable adapter for the water inlet hose and an extension drain pipe(if required).I use it full load every alternate day and the clothes are much cleaner. As expected from BOSCH.I would recommend this to other who wish to use it for domestic purpose and especially if you have kids at home.
245,2018-07-28,4,Worth buying....,"Worth buying the German made most reliable Bosch washing machine. Using it from last 8 months and no complaint till date. Wash quality is very good and very less noise, placed near my bed room and don't feel any disturbance. If ur getting a good offer, just go for it. Amazon support in bangalore is very good."

I called customer care number 8067521111. Bosch representative advised to call them on Monday. Is there any online method for registering complaint ? Thank you for prompt help !!"

249,2020-11-02,4,Excellent product,Superb machine. User friendly and very effective washing.Low noise levelValue for money.Strongly recommend.

251,2020-07-24,4,perfect üëå machine but poor installation process and still they not updated,I don't like installation schedule and after many request they installed it but not updated and I m getting to reschedule massages

254,2021-11-14,5,"Value for money, noise, vibration free","Good choice, stable, spacious for full bucket + load, water-power saving"
255,2021-07-28,5,One of the best,It's a very heavy machine works great.The only drawback I found was there should be some notification for the transport bolt in the display.
256,2017-09-04,5,Great washing solution from BOSCH,"Hats off to Bosch...Excellent machine....after all German technology!!!...Only thing is that it requires 3/4 inch male treaded tap, for which I had to take efforts to search in market. Temporary solution is available with demo person & he can provide a adaptor for Rs 300 ( do not expect bill for this). Installation & demo service is good though I reside in rural area far from Pune. They installs in two days with very good communication mechanism in place. Saying about machine, very low noise level, low vibration & good wash quality."
257,2016-10-24,4,Good Product from Bosch,"Excellent product from great brand. Thx to Amazon for on time delivery and wishing 2days from delivery installation demo is completed. It's been a week now I'm using the machine quit soundless with high spinning 1200rpm makes you cloths so clean and almost dry. I suggest if you're looking for good high performance machine go for it.!!Cons - Minimum range of water pressure required, so if your water pressure is low then it's not going to use."
258,2020-12-23,5,Good value for money,I am very much satisfied with the performance of this Bosch Front load washing machine. It is easy to use and has low noise levels. Quality of washing is extremely good ; better than my old top load washing machine.
259,2020-08-23,1,Doesnot do the intended work,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†First impressionThe product in itself is good. But a good product can be bad and average can be good based on price point.. and when it comes to pricing of this washing machine the rate variations can make one feel cheated since 10 percent sale you may get it expensive than a 5 percent sale considering Amazon would change the Basic price as they pleaseLeave the pricing aside, it is a heavy sturdy and expensive machine (if any time U get bosch team called but that is true for all front loads) which would tick in almost all boxes---------+--++++++++++++++++++++++++After few months of useThe soap remains at the rim and also after the clothes have been washed fully there is lots of detergent residue .. pic and video attached put the clothes post wash in water and after fifth time rinsing the water became clear and yes I am using front load detergent of Arial and yes I am not over doing with detergent and yes my earlier top load was betterSO BUY A TOP LOAD INSTEAD SINCE ALL THE ISSUES OF FRONT LOAD WE OVERLOOKED CONSIDERING THAT IT WPULD GIVE BETTER WASH BUT THAT IS CLEARLY NOT TRUE"
260,2021-08-14,3,Machine needs maintenance which is costly,"Machine needs regular cleaning, cleaning powder is very costly, you have to clean drainage every week"
261,2019-08-25,5,Made washing super easy at even 55 plus !!,"I am 55 plus lady and my mother aged 74 purchased the machine as we have frequent change in maid and it's difficult for us to manage the washing by ourselves. This bosch machine has come as a breather for us and made life easier. Using already for 2 months now, very convenient and easy to use. Made my washing work so easy now."
262,2020-07-11,4,Happy with the purchaseüí∞üëê,"Overall it is good, Easy to use, I feel its too small when compared to ifb and bosch service is pathetic"
263,2019-10-16,4,"Nice product, installation needs improvement","Nice product, working seemsless for me, just installation service need to improve.. As no one turned up for installation on my first appointment. Also charged 350/- more for adaptor.Machine vibration is quite high at drying cycles."
264,2016-12-30,5,Lives up to its high reputation.,I was lucky to have spotted this when it went up on a lightening deal on Amazon. I was convinced with the product quality reading the number of product reviews. Was wary of the installation time by Bosch since that was one repeated negative feedback across reviews. Have to say it was a very smooth experience and the machine was installed in two days time.The product is excellent and you forget it's around...thanks to the negligible noise and vibration.Settings are also very versatile and it takes care of multiple usage conditions.Great buy and superb service by Amazon and Bosch.
265,2018-03-18,5,BOSCH. Is this my perfect partner?,as a home owner i have been using my own fair share of home appliancesthe bosch 7 KG automatic front loading washing machineis the most reliable and functional home appliances which can helpyou in your most desperate time of need.imagine one day you spilled some ketchup on your shirt for workwhat do you do?you just simply load up your washing machine andget going withe the washBOSCH does the rest for youmost effieciently
266,2020-08-22,5,Amazing,"Cleans the clothes. There are several options, but I just use standard 30 min clean and it is able to clean ALL my clothes which include - 2 kids, 4 adults and other furnishing in the house. Really silent compared to other machines! I would highly recommend it."
267,2021-05-29,5,Quality product,Product is best. Cleaning is perfect and machine noise is very low. One query is why company is not providing long power cable and stand for washing machine.
268,2018-07-03,4,Excellent and easy to handle,Worth to buy it and I am using this product from last month and found very comfortable for operating it. Complete sound and vibration less.The installation guy came on time and explained  very well on how to operate machine in easy way. I would recommend to buy this product guys.
269,2019-12-06,5,Great Washing machine,Great Washing machine..time saver & decent wash quality.I would recommend it for every household where both spouses are working & have no time to clean the clothes...although no machine can meet the hand wash quality but this machine is too good. Also I found washing in this machine is gentle with clothes. Lots of programmes to cover your seasonal needs.
270,2018-09-27,4,Design falut for machine inlet pipe,Machine is good. But  issue face by all Indian people  to water inlet size to due to German machine design.. As per design need to fit 3/4 valve which is not available easily in india so we need to take valve of 1/2 then fitted neepal with  expansion to 3/4 size where the machine inlet get fitt
271,2019-10-18,5,Awesome machine at a great price,DO NOT TURN ON WASHING MACHINE BEFORE REMOVING TRANSPORTATION SCREWS. Installation guy will remove it. Also level the machine perfectly because at 1200rpm if your machine vibrates then it will shorten its life spanMachine is great. Buzzer on completion there. Dryer mode is very helpful. Clothes can be added and removed while a cycle is running. I got it for 23k
272,2021-03-14,5,Bosch is boss,ProsCompact sizePlastic quality greatEasy to useMixwash/cotton 40 degree take only 45min to 70 min(depend on setting)Consume less waterVery low noiseConsI didn't find yet

275,2020-11-22,4,good,need stand.. it vibrant .. hope it will normal in good stand...
276,2019-06-29,3,Recommend,"Noise level is too much during dry mode apart from this others are working as expected.Product has delivery as promised date and without any damages .Washing machine is too much heavy ,would be too much difficult in case of shift.Demo and explanation was good by Bosch company but they suggest to go for extra warranty for 3/4yrs and also informed few things won't be covered with default warranty.You be ready to pay extra charge accessories for tap connector etc ."
277,2020-08-26,4,Installation is guy did not come,Machine is giving too much noise. Installation guy did not comeNo response from customercare
278,2017-10-03,4,Wonderful machine but pathetic installation service from Amazon,Machine is fantastic. Worth every penny spent. Silently does the job for us.But installation service by Amazon was pathetic. Got it installed after 10 days which was frustrating. Literally threatened them that I will return the machine and got it installed. It just took half n hr for installation since the set up from my previous machine was intact.
279,2021-03-28,4,Good,V Good product

All wash programs are useful for regular use....Adding this after 1 year of use. We use the machine regularly. no troubles till date !Washes better than other branded washing machines...For better wash quality use 'Ariel Matic' washing powder.
281,2020-10-17,5,Great product,Though it is expensive in the overall washing machine segment but I can feel the difference in the clothes.. top load ruins the fabric.. I am super happy with the result.. if u can spend extra this is worth giving a short
282,2020-08-04,4,Bad customer service but good product,Wash quality is definitely better than top load. Machine operates quietly and drying level is also decent.

Awaiting person for installation.  Since we cannot use  a standered water connector in this model,  Bosch should have provided that too with the machine  to make the installation easy.  Or else modify the product to suit the accessories what is easily available in the market. I reduced 1 star for this. Shall comment later about the performance."
288,2018-11-27,5,Best Machine In This Price Range,"Brought machine for Rs 23400 ,best buy  in this price range ,do not expect more, washing options are minimal ,washing quality is good, low noise , no vibrations , But machine is too heavy (76Kg)  to move by single person ,only amazon person( not Bosch person ) comes for installation dont  expect much from him he shows you only basic remaining learn from you tube demos"
289,2018-12-20,5,Best Washing Machine in this class !!,"So there are only 2 types of washing machines that fits well in this class - IFB & Bosch. Bosch washing machines particularly this one, is good for family and looks elegant and simple. After searching for lot of other variants, I choose this one. It has variable timers available so you can choose a program for 15 mins, etc. This also performs good.If you have budget around 20-23k, definitely this fits you."
290,2020-07-17,5,Really worth every penny. Go for it!!!!,I have received the product on 15th july and the installation done on 17th july. So many people mentioned about delay in customer service. But i have not faced any such problems. Overall quality of the product is the best. Without any second idea go for it.

294,2019-03-19,4,Worth buying the bosch unit,"Worth buying the bosch unit, this machine gives you the complete laundry service, apart from ironing, only flaw in this machine is it doesnt operate with the moderate water pressure, you need to install the pressure pump for seamless usage."
295,2022-06-20,1,Don't purchase bosch,"It's gud machine but after 1year when servicing has to be done, there is no proper servicing centre. In name of authorized servicing center they will take money from u and will not repair machine also no bill warranty card will be handed to you. Worst experience. I paid 9500 for servicing they had taken money. W Machine is same like earlier with error and no bill handed over. This happened with me m from Bangalore"
296,2020-08-30,4,Good,It is good...just go for it if u r searching for a good one‚úåüëç
297,2020-08-20,2,Think before you go for such a big brand,"It was sept 2019 we bougth this Machine.  Within a month or so, our power supply of the house started to trip. We under the impression that new machine cannot have issues, we rather tried checking our old refrigerator for any issues but could not find it.Now after 10 months, one fine day it stopped working. And since then power also stopped tripping.We raised a complaint to Bosch as the mschine being under warranty, nobody has called or visited for 10 days even after so many follows up.Covid situation is understood for less manpower available but a call atleast could have been expected from such a Brand. After Sales service is also pathetic."
298,2020-10-25,4,Value for money product,"Great delivery from Amazon,  Great product, the Best brand."
299,2015-05-17,5,Good Sturdy Workhorse with less noise and vibration,"Got this fulfilled by KCN Shop. The competitive cost displayed on amazon and the additional amazon coupon discount offered made it a good reason to buy. The Bosch washing machine was installed by the Bosch company folks with 2 years full warranty and additional 10 years motor warranty ( May 2015 offer). The first week of using the washing machine seems good. A more comprehensive review of washing machine can be done after 1 year or so. All in all , I have been satisfied by both amazon customer service and KCN shop customer service. The apprehension of buying a washing machine or large appliance over online channel has been cleared and would not mind buying appliances online. Thanks amazon."

We contacted Bosch customer care for installation, and they promptly turned up within 48 hours of the call as promised. We run the machine for the first time and the results are good. It removed almost all water so that the clothes can be dried under shadow in one or two hours."

326,2018-07-05,5,Buy without a second think..!!,"I was in too much hasitation to buy this machine as this is my first fully automatic washing machine. Before this, i had a semi auto top load only.After using 2 months my opinion is that Bosch washing machine is best. The washing quality is good,  water usage & Power consumption is appropriate and in last, noise is very very less..!!So.. buy without a second though..!"

As usual prompt delivery from Amazon. There has been multiple reviews about delay in installation. It was not a case for me. Bosch team came within 24 hours for installation and a wonderful experience.I am using this machine for the past 2 weeks. No visible vibrations even at 1200 RPM and very smooth with very minimal and acceptable sound while running.
328,2019-08-15,4,Good product,Works great. Size of drum smaller than I expected compared to a top load. Cleaning is good. Service for installation vwas on time and so was delivery. Will recommend to others.
329,2018-11-20,5,Awesome machine,"Nice looking, perfectly working. Noiseless, less water consumption and less power consumption. We have option to alter the rpm accordingly. Difference b/w WAK24168IN and WAK24268IN is we dont have option to alter temperature here. And the installation person charged me 350 extra for a clamp to fit the water absorbing pipe to the tap, which is free for other washing machines.Functionality of the machine is perfect."
330,2020-09-15,4,PRODUCT WAS GOOD BUT SERVICING PERSON WAS VERY PROBLAMETIC,"PRODUCT WAS GOOD .BUT ONLY THING IS SERVICE, SERVICE WAS VERY POOR"
331,2017-11-22,5,This product from Bosch is damn good.,"It has been a month and half, The product is damn good. There is not a bid of sound when it washes. the time consumed is bit more compared to Top load washing machines, still the quality of wash too is good. Options are basic in nature but we will not be able to do much with various options available such as adjusting the RPM etc. Daily wash and Super clean are the most useful ones."
332,2019-12-13,5,Washing made easy!,"Brilliant device..it is truly a very user friendly machine..no problems yet..washes clothes gently, no damage and dries them up quite well-using for around a month now. Great delivery time from Amazon with installation support!However the Bosch technician need to change their attitude and pay more attention to the customer needs!"
333,2019-11-03,5,Awesome product.,"Delivery done very next day. Its really easy to use and cleaning quality is above expectations.Installation was a bit hectic, had a tough time to arrange technician visit.

335,2020-10-24,5,Silent and excellent wash,Only thing missing is temperature control. There's is another model from bosh that has the support to control temperature for each program. But rest all excellent. Do you descale the machine based on your water supply

The washing is just top notch.As some have pointed out, the installation problems, we luckily faced nothing and the installation was immediate, we received it on the weekend and the installation was complete on monday! so again very swift.and also the water pressure problems, we haven't faced any.. it works great!"

341,2022-03-07,1,Lots of issues after 2 years,"Using since 2 years.  As soon as the warrenty expires this machine will start giving you loads of problems. And the service engineers aren't a help either.I was first told to change door lock. 1600+800 service charges. The machine didn't start.Then I was told to change power module. 8000+800.Then I was told the motor is the problem and needs to be changed. Luckily motor has extended warranty.Could have been better if I had bought a new IFB machine than this piece of scrap.Update: it's been 3 months, 5 visits from the so called technician and it still doesn't work"

But it might be there I am not able to identify that.

470,2019-11-25,3,Bosch,We received the washing machine but they took long time for installation. The product had a defect as the fabric conditioner unit is NOT AT ALL working. Overall not expected this from Bosch washing machine
471,2019-03-10,5,Good product...go for it...,Easy to use.Interface could have been simpler but it's not all that bad.Took about a week to teach mom how to use it.I'd suggest a washing machine stand (costs about 1400) as it damps the vibration when the machine goes in spin dry mode.

478,2021-08-27,1,Don't go for Bosch Washing Machine.,Not Recommended to any customer. Kind of sell and no warranty.My washing machine got damaged after 7-8 months of used. I have raised incident two months before but no proper service by Bosch. Not recommended. Very bad service. Imagine after warranty over incase of damage how many times engineer will visit and how much service fee you need to pay. In my case 3 engineers visited 4 times neither Bosch Returning the product not agreeing to Return the product. Also they will not respond to emails. Visit the Twitter page of Bosch you will find the reality.

491,2016-10-18,5,"Great Product, Cheating BOSCH Installation Technicians","This is a great product with high quality. Go for it. Only issue is with BOSCH Installation technicians. They are greedy and cheats. Do not buy things from them, things such as Drum Cleaning Powder, Hard Water Filter, Inlet Pipe adapter etc. BOSCH Technicians extorted Rs. 1600/- from me for these items. Same items are available on Amazon.in in Rs. 1000/-.So beware of these technicians. Otherwise BOSCH Washing machine is best in class."
492,2016-05-11,4,Amazing product from bosch,"Nice product from Bosch, purchased this product after lot of confusion and reviews about bosch vs ifb and decided to go for bosch. Delivery, installation and demonstration was simply amazing. Installation guy recommended to install watet softener but I am not sure about it,  so decided not to fit.

497,2019-03-17,5,Great Machine!!,The experience has been great with machine. You are advised to use detergent poweder recommended for front load machines. Do use descaler after 3 to 4 months of use. Amazon has been real helpful while sorting out issues. Wish to buy more appliances from Amazon.

500,2016-12-20,5,Good product from.bosch,"Build quality is good. Service quality is also good except technician asks for 300 rs for fitting a 50 rs adapter. Hence think before giving him 300 bucks for an adapter. U can buy it in local hardware shop and fit yourself. This adapter is used to connect inlet pipe to ur tap outlet.As faR as washing machine is concerned, washing is quite good. It makes minimal sound."

504,2021-01-07,5,Damaged product,The product is amazing but  the product they gave to me has some damages
505,2021-10-23,1,Poor after sales service,Pathetic after sales service. My machine break down. Their service center at Mumbai is saying it will take 20 days to reach spare and after that in 2-3 days they will repair it. More than 2 months they are not able to fix the problem.So just imagine if they took nearly 25 days to repair at place like Mumbai.. imagine service in other smaller cities.So before purchase product of Bosch kindly keep this in mind.In short no after sales service....
506,2019-08-17,5,I think I‚Äôm gonna use it for several years!,Just what I needed. So easy to use and maintain. Has all the functions you could think of for different types of fabrics you need to wash. And the clothes get cleaned up pretty well even the collars and sleeves!
507,2019-10-22,3,Water pressure problem,Not even working where per minute water outcome is 5 litre..even though website description says it works for low water pressure. Buy only If you think per minute water outcome is around 10 litre.

509,2019-11-04,5,Excellent washing product,"BOSCH washing machine is an excellent product. It meets all requirements for cleaning your clothes. It is noiseless, hes very less vibrations while cleaning.The company could give one/two accessories along with the product to promote sales."

Quality of their products are very good. They design products very well, they don't release products in a hurry.Pros:Cleans dirt almost 99%.

516,2017-08-28,5,Can go for it without any doubt,Its really good product. I am really wondered that.. there is no sound at all when it is running. During spinning you will hear little sound. Otherwise its really a great product. But Bosch team will collect 400/- odd for tap connector and 1600/- (not remembered exactly for stand). They will also press for extra warranty. So be PREPARED
517,2019-06-03,3,Invoice of bill,"Hi Team,  I have raised complain about this product..  But they are asking about bill..  Can you  provide bill please..  I didn't get when it delivered and invoice not in my mail as well"
518,2019-10-22,4,Srikanth,Good product I bought two machines both are working excellent
519,2019-07-26,1,Beware before investing on Bosch in Hyderabad area - Pathetic after sales service standards,"Their Service standards are extremely bad. Looks like boasting of a German brand is only for improving their Sales. They have absolutely no check in place to ensure complaints are closed in time. It has been 45 days since I raised a complaint and till now the complaint is not closed. They were supposed to replace a faulty part for which they took 15 days time when the technician inspected the washing machine. Subsequently, I once received a call from the local Hyderabad team informing me of the arrival of the part and asking for an appointment. After booking an appointment, they never showed up. It has been 2 weeks till now. Nobody even bothered to contact me to close the complaint till now. They finally woke up after I called their toll free number again and gave a piece of my mind. It shows how serious Bosch looks into ""after sales service"".So,.if you are expecting a better service, think before investing on a Bosch Washing Machine..."

524,2018-09-01,5,Great performance. Ideal for a family of four,"Very good product. The only puzzling thing is that in case the water supply isn‚Äôt turned on by mistake, the machine still goes through wash cycles for almost 17 minutes before sounding the alarm. This wasn‚Äôt the case with my Siemens WM (same company) earlier.Maybe BOSCH aught to look into it"
525,2019-11-25,4,Now Bosch is available at reasonable price,Functions perfectly..... Installation was quickWashing is neat/Clean

590,2020-01-14,1,Dont fall on brand name!,"Dont buy this product looking at the brand name like what i did.  Definitely Bosch is a reputed company but their washing machine is too poor,i dont know whether its this particular model or their whole washing machine range.What made me give a review like this is, it ""doesn't make the clothes clean"" and moreover the clothes looks dull after wash. I previously had a basic onida washing machine which was some 10K...and then i wanted washing machine with inbuilt heater for more hygienic wash,so looking at the brand name,i picked this one. Now im terribly disappointed that it doesn't even remove basic stains. The only thing which is better is lint free and thats all. Please go for any IFB washing machine,i personally know people who have been using IFB washing machine for more than 9 years..it still functions like brand new. Dont fall for any brand names!"

603,2016-09-27,5,"Too old, get the new",Nothing wrong with the product (see the 5 stars?)... But I am just letting you know that this product was releases in Oct 2014. Newer Bosch products are lesser power consuming and more quiter. Although at least 6k to 10k costlier than this one here. Amazon does run heavy discounts on the newer products from time to time: I'd suggest you grab them then.

Had to scrap it as it became a little over used and rickety.Please make a proper choice and ensure you compare a few machines before making a choice. These don‚Äôt come cheap and a lot of money hoes into buying these machines.Good luck on your purchase!

630,2020-07-17,1,Cloudtail and Amazon cheated me with this ‚Çπ30000 machine.,"I've bought model WAK24168IN. On Amazon it claims the programs such as Allergy Plus, Hygiene, Super Clean, Drum Clean. But what I got is the same model without these programs. Doesn't Amazon's own Cloudtail cheated me, with a mediocre model version. I researched and bought Bosch WAK24168IN based on these important features. Installation is still pending, don't know what more surprises, hope Cloudtail wouldn't have removed the components also. I could return, but carrying 2 floors of this heavy metal up and down without a lift refrain me from doing it. They also not delivered the filter, which is supposed to be part of the pack. Need to spend another ‚Çπ500 for the same. Cloudtail and Amazon are equal culprits."

637,2017-10-08,5,"Good Product, experience with seller was very good","Good Product, experience with seller was very good, on time Delivery well Handled.But not happy with Bosch service, it has been more than 10 days & installation still pending from Bosch service end, no use following up with them and even escalating. that to in Bangalore."

686,2020-07-19,1,Highly unsatisfied!,"I have bought this machine last week, i am highly unsatisfied with this product as in the mix load cycle that claims clothes will be washed in 44 mins - it always take 1.5 hours for machine to complete that - and twice all the detergent was floating in the water even after 1.5 hours. Apart from this, twice it completed the cycle in 1.5 hours and all the clothes were completely wet - that is it dint dry the clothes at all ! Its total wastage of myMoney- i feel i would have invested in LG and would have got far better product that this."

692,2019-01-25,1,Defective Bosh Product and Pathetic Bosch Customer Service,"The machine is faulty - although the power is on it won't work at the time of product demo.Called up the Bosch customer care and their first reaction was denial of services insisting that someone from Amazon should do the needful since the product was purchased from their platform. On further insistance, they told us that we would be getting a call from the nearest service centre immediately. Unfortunately it is well past 2 hours and we are yet to receive a call. Apparently the service centre executives only work between 11 AM to 7 PM on weekdays!Thoroughly disappointed with the ""Bosch Experience"" - so unbecoming from a German firm. Hope the guys at Amazon make up for it!"
693,2020-11-19,2,Beware of,Machine is working fine. The machine came without stand. But the person who came for installation sold machine stand at inflated price. Once he installed the stand he told us price.  They will give offer many thing to buy. Pls buy them from any online site.
694,2020-03-03,5,Bosch is good.,I was using an IFB front loading for a couple decades.Too early to say much about it but so far real good.
695,2019-12-01,5,Bosch is boss,"Really grate product,properly delivered by Amazon,But service providers are not cooperating as per our acceptation, need to sqez them.Value of mony product"
696,2019-02-24,4,Heavy duty,Good..but u should purchase new stand..existing one will not fit

707,2020-11-05,1,The Exchange program is a scam!,"The whole "" Buy with exchange"" thing is a scam. They lure customers by offering them attractive exchange offers but at the time of picking up the older machine, they come up with some excuse to not pick it up. This is despite the machine being in full working condition and no damages. They look for some spot of rust / wear and tear on the outer body and claim that this cannot be picked up for exchange.So, when buying the machine, do consider the fact that the exchange offer will not work out in most cases."

You need to follow up with them and even Area Manager or Regional Manager can help in any way.It‚Äôs worst decision of my life to go for a Bosch product.

It is not a full automated as there is a knob manually need to switch off once wash is over (kind of cheated)3.  So much of wrinkles in the clothes that makes you spend additional hard time to iron the clothes.4. Overall am not satisfied with product.5. Only not much noise and no vibration are the good features in this product.

This is after multiple folllowup and escalation and registering service request number.  Bosch call Center says that within 48 working hours technician will call. They explained a day has 8 working hours so it may take 6 days for technicians to call and thereafter installation. Poor service definition to fool clients. Since I purchased this machine in exchange, will be without washing machine for this long time. Ahh. Amazon should also work on installation commitment of their partners sellers."

986,2017-10-19,1,Lethargic approach from the Bosch customer service,It's been about a week since when I have been waiting after the Bosch washing machine was delivered. I spoke to a Bosch customer service representative Saira to raise a demo and installation request. I was told that the Bosch engineer would contact me for an appointment to visit my place yet nothing has happened thereafter. I understand that Bosch has great reputation in the United Kingdom market and their products are awesome. They aspire to establish their footprints in the very competitive Indian market but sorry to say if their customer service and the after sales service is such they will struggle. Hope my concern catches the eye of the Bosch brand promotion executive desk. Also Amazon takes notice of such events that can affect your credibility as well!

1025,2016-10-19,1,Pathetic service from Bosch.. stay away..,"Bosch is new in India and service is pathetic. We bought this machine and as per process called Bosch service call center to get the machine installed. We were told we will get the same done within 2 business days. 2 days passed by and no one even called, let alone come for installation. We had to call back and were told they are escalating our case immediately. Again nothing has happened to our case and 2 more days have passed. If this is the service Bosch provides at the time of installation itself we are scared of the service we will receive when we eventually need the machine serviced / repaired in the future. We are immediately initiating the return of the machine and will need to go with one of the more established brands in Indian market."

Again after returning to India, we bought bosch front load. I feel the quality has deteriorated much over time. I use surf excel mati detergent. It fails to remove any kind of stains. All it does is freshens the clothes and whitens them a bit. No stain removal. With very young children around. My laundry has tons of food stains, soil on it. It fails to remove them. Very disappointed. Any tips are welcome."

Consumer help no gives ONLY assurances as they also don't know who is person Incharge of the area. Selling good product with very poor backup team defeats and kills a quality product by such emarketing companies. They should be serious and more professional in their after sell services.

1328,2019-10-22,1,Amazon Can we get negative stars added as a review feedback,Do not buy this product. First of all the demo was delayed from Bosch and when we started using it for the second wash itself the machine started producing noise and the vibration is too much. It took three days to get to the customer care and to register a service request. Totally waste of time and money. Amazon should think of giving negative stars for such expensive products at least.

On calling the service person he asks us to change the drum assembly which will cost approx. 8000. In addition we may ( read likely)need to change some other part for 2000+. Hence let's assume 10000. We have used extensively but the same issue is with my aunt who used it rarely more than once a week. If in 5 yrs this is the level of durability I question the value of the Brand.

Furthermore, they must check the charges for extended warranty as I feel that the charges are too high compared to most of other makes. These charges for annual warranty can be more than Rs. 5000/- per annum if you don't opt for extended warranty at time of installation."
1999,2019-05-15,3,Installation process not professionally .,We have received the Machine as per the schedule. But we have faced problem for installation as the installation engineer are more interested for selling the product rather than installation and demonstration. They have charged RS 350 for the pipe even the tap was very closed to the Machine. Not happy with the installation process of Amazon.
2000,2019-01-29,3,Good wash !,"No problem with delivery or installation Uses less water,clothes clean but drying is very less as compared with my top loading machine!"
2001,2022-08-05,1,Worst service from Bosch.,Worst service from Bosch.... I bought it from Amazon. It has some circuit problem and it make large sound. I am waiting for repairing parts from last two months. Worst service from Bosch. Not recommended to buy Bosch washing machine.

2003,2020-08-14,3,Not worth,"We had bought a Bosch washing machine in 2016. E-17 was the error which used to come everytime during the washing process. After 4 years of.xontacting some service cwntre or another, we finally lodged the complaint which was addressed at Delhi. Bit it took seven days for the technicians from the service centre to.figure out the problem. 3 technicians worked on the issue. As per them, the actual problem got rectified but the door closing sensor malfuntioned which after 7 days, they told it is beyond them. You get it checked from someone else.It has been a pain staking week as we have been stuck up because of rheaxhine being unserviceable. Before the machine was opened by the technicians from rhenservcie centre, atleast it qorked with the error coming and going, but now it is not coming ON itself. Buying such a costly product, of a valuable conapny has left us with only a scrap, not knowing what to do with it. I really don't know whether Bosch machine servicing and repair can be done in India also or not. But it has sucked our hard earned money and left with no option but to wash out clothes with hands."

2007,2018-11-23,3,Good performance of Bosch washing Machine,It's porfomance is good and very less water consumption. Also very low sound generated while it's rotate at 1200 RPM mean good silent product. But I face one issues by ordering that was I got damage product when it's first diliverd due to poor quality packing and transportation but Amazon replace it within 1 week so overall the performance of Bosch washing machine is good. I am quite happy with buying this product.
2008,2017-07-14,1,One Star,not good and not working as expected.

2011,2019-04-04,3,Power cord small,I purchased a digital 8 kg washing machine fully automaticMajor issue in this productPower cord is so small cannot small move washing machine
2012,2015-10-29,3,E:17 E:17 and E:17.. error message for insufficient water pressure.,"Dont buy this machine if your water tank is just one floor above your apartment. This machine needs a minimum water pressure, and I am surprised I havent seen many more complaints about this issue.Our machine keeps throwing the E:17 message 4-5 times per wash and you reset it by pressing the Start/Pause button. And after restart it will add anywhere between 5-10 minutes to the wash time. So the Daily Load (44 minutes) ends up being 90 minutes long, with 5 times manual intervention.And during the rinse cycle half the water seems to be draining through the drain holes at the bottom of the front opening, the comes from a hole at 10 o'clock position. This might explain why my clothes are stiff after drying, they are not getting rinsed thoroughly.The machine is silent (except during the final spin), I will give Bosch credit for that.PS: I didnt buy through Amazon, bought it at a store."
2013,2019-10-31,4,Bosch is boss,"I was purchased this machine one month's before from Amazon after a long research, this machine is perfect for 4 family members, value for money and Bosch customer service also is good. No complaints as of now. Bosch is boss"

2016,2020-06-21,1,Do not buy bosch,"Do not buy Bosch products. The service is the worst in India. They don‚Äôt answer calls. Toll free number doesn‚Äôt work. When you finally somehow get in touch with the service centre that is if you are lucky, they are the most incompetent people. I bought this dishwasher and after 2 months it stopped working. Since then I have been after customer service everyday. When they finally sent someone to check it out after a long time that fellow was incompetent. He ordered some part that was working completely fine. Again the next technician tried to diagnose the actual problem and ordered another part. They said it will arrive in 4 days. It has been 6 weeks now and they are just stalling. I guess the products of Bosch are defective along with that they have an equally incompetent customer service. I have faced same problem once with Bosch washing machine which stopped working and the service person had no idea what happened so that‚Äôs a waste now. So my advice is for any appliance it is better to avoid Bosch"
2017,2020-11-28,1,misleading and false information  given about replacement,Very disappointing customer support services. No solutionz provided. Also Amazon misleading people by giving false Information regarding replacement of product. Repeated calls made by me but the matter was not escalated and they also refuse to register complaint.. Don't get misled by Fulfilled by Amazon as it doesn't fulfill anything. In fact they will go to the extent of refusing to replace the project by saying that there is no reverse logistics when it is well accepted fact that people buy expensive products on the representation that replacement will be done without any hassle
2018,2020-01-24,1,Pathetic mathine this 7 kg frontload,"Dont go for it pathetic bosch service ,  they are really dheet,  machine is not user friendly you cant select the temperature on your own while in other brands you can you can go for up model dont go for 7 kg go for up model this 7 kg model is pathetic and it while washing flushes out bubbles from surf inserting side and from drum it is really very pathetic  , and on this problem service engineer says if you ll insert more detergent it will flush out bubbles it is not a logic , service is also not good , service engineer dont come within 48 hours you have to wait and wait"
2019,2019-03-14,2,"If it develops a fault, be ready for long wait times for repairs.","Bought this is aeound 20th November, 18 and have been using  since. Does why is says. Installation and delivery were good.Sudden stopped working after a power cut.Technician says the power module was 'shorted'  due to voltage fluctuations. Also, the door lock is not working anymore. Turnaround time for replacement parts is min. 7 days, which is significant for a model as popular as this in NCR region. A huge inconvenience, but have no option but to live with it. I don't know.the service levels of IFB or LG so can't comment how it compares against them. Also, why should important component like power module dont have a built in protection against power fluctuations for Indian conditions?!"

2025,2016-11-21,2,"Good product, bad service.","Product is good, but bosch policy/service is notAfter receiving the washing machine i called Bosch for Installation/Demo, that guy told me that its free first time but it will be chargeable 800/- in case if i shift my home. Anyway i took an appointment on Saturday 3PM, but the installation guy came at 6:00PM. And after coming to home he asked me to call a plumber for the fitting. While the plumber was fitting the machine, he provide a connector for water inlet coz the size of our pipes and the machine input is different. Later he charged 300/- for that small connector.The point to be noted here is that this installation/demo is actually worth of 800/- as per the company, but there is no installation service at all, its just a demo (why should we pay 800/- for a demo which we can read in the manual or see in the YouTube). In case of a AC the installation cost used to be 1000/- but they do soo much work to fit the AC.And secondly this bosch guy sold me one small connector for 300/- which i could have got from the market in 50-100."
2026,2020-06-22,4,nice,very nice product
2027,2019-04-15,5,18 month of use... right time to reward this product,"Hi,Brought this model in Oct-17 for 27K with 1500 cash back.Surprised to see that this product has maintained it's prestige by not reducing it's price even after 18 months.If you are in dilemma to buy Front Load & Top Load then let me help you by saying that don't look back, Front Load is far far better.When it comes to select the brand for front load then basis on my experience, I can recommend this model of Bosch.This works awesome for family of 6. Consumes less power, water & washing powder. Wash quality is superb. The noise level is so low that my mixer grinder beats it in generation noise! Just ensure not to mount it on any stand, it loves to remain grounded. Use Descaler once in every 4-5 months.Being an Engineer, was skeptical on this & purchased this after so many comparison, research & user feedback. Go for this, you will not regret.All the best!"

2032,2019-02-04,5,Purchase the Washing Machine Tap before calling for Installation,"Brought it offline and it's just perfect Washing Machin.All the pros and cons are said in the other reviews so I directly want to mention just one point* Buy Washing Machine Tap which need to be installed ( since the filter, which is provided along with the washing machine, it's end doesn't fit to the local tap).The Bosch Executive will charge you Rs.400 - 450 towards the cost and installation of that tap , So you can avoid that by purchasing online/ outside which costs Rs.250 or so before hand."

Its giving a very perfect wash for all types of clothes in ease manner . Operating procedures also very simple and clear for all age peoples .Important thing is the quality of the cloth is not impacted and it is very less in water consumption but giving better wash quality compared to hand wash .Bosh service also excellent since my uncle's washing machine got damaged due to high voltage but without any questions the Bosh has replaced the 10K worth of parts at free of cost while people's in the same apartments were charged for that  service of machine's of other companies even they are under warranty .We can go for this Machine without any second thought .

2063,2019-05-22,1,Never buy Siemens washing machine,"I had purchased SIEMENS Front-loading washing machine in February 2016 which was quite expensive. On 14th May 2019, when washing operation was going on, it suddenly stopped working. Burning smell was coming and little amount of smoke was also coming out. When I called Siemens authorized service person (who took Rs. 800 as visit fee) to check the problem, he said that the drum is out of order. He also said that the problem can be solved only by implanting a new drum at the cost of Rs. 9035/-. It's a big amount just within 3 years after the purchase. IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE AS THE MACHINE HAS GONE OUT OF ORDER JUST 3 YEARS AFTER THE PURCHASE. I have taken Bajaj allianz extended warranty of 2 years, but this company has bluntly refused to offer any financial help.  I HAD BOUGHT SIEMENSS WASHING MACHINE CONSIDERING ITS HIGH REPUTATION, BUT MY MACHINE HAS RECEIVED A MAJOR TECHNICAL PROBLEM JUST WITHIN 3 YEARS. THIS IS NOT FARE. FRONT LOADING WASHING MACHINE:MODEL 48426. So never buy Siemens expensive washing machines. Also never take extended warranty from Bajaj allianz as at the time of buying this warranty they never explain the details and intricacies of policy and when your claim is of high amount they simply refuse and tell this part doesn't cover under extended warranty."

We raised the issue promptly with Bosch Customer Service the very next day. Having made several calls to Bosch Customer Service Centre and despite continued reassurances, the door has still not been fixed. We have been told several times that the replacement part is on its way and the machine will be fixed soon.For the past 40+ days we have had to wash the clothes by hand and by other means.Deeply angry and frustrated with Bosch's very poor Service Support.Update - after 50 days and much chasing door was replaced.Update Apr 2016 - Machine not working. Board defect. Replacement part INR 25k (per Bosch Tec). Decided to get new IFB 8kg."

We were not in a position to return it as we had laundry to be done and old machine (exchanged) was already picked up by the delivery guys. Will have to think twice before ordering such items for sure. Disappointed....

2081,2020-06-18,4,1 year usage review!!!,I bought it last year and have had no complaints till now. I will breakdown the review into parts1. PackagingIt arrived in original box and it was unwrapped after delivery by Amazon guys. The packaging was pretty good.2. InstallationEven though i have done lot of research on how to use it I still opted to wait for the installation technician. Before the installation guys comes do have Dishwasher salt + Rinse aid liquid + Detergent ready. Theses can be bought separately. There is also a tablet which has Detergent + rinse aid but its costly. You also may need a stand and cover for dishwasher.3. UsageAfter the demo I kept fully soiled kadhai & tea vessel and let the machine run on 'Intensive kadhai' option. The program run for 1 hr and I got sparkling vessels. I took photos of the output and shared with all my half knowledge friends and that relative who gives philosophy about buying gadgets. They were shocked with result. :)This will resume from where it stopped in case of power outage.4. MaintenanceThe downside of owning a dishwasher are that periodically you need to open the waster collection basket and wash it. I do it once in 2months. Also the detergent and rinseaid are costly but in the long run it saves you from frustration of washing dirty vessels.5. WHY YOU SHOULD BUY THIS- If you don't want to depend on your maid.(Now during lockdown its a life saver)- If you want steam sanitized and 100% dried utensils.- If you have space to accommodate this machine in your balcony. Kindly look at measurements and decide.6. WHY YOU SHOULD NOT BUT THIS- If you have a maid who never takes leave & cleans the dishes with towel after rinsing.- If you want to listen to you friends and family who give gyaan without using this.- If you fail to realize the value of this machine in the long run.- If you are even lazy to load and arrange the vessels properly inside this dishwasher.- If you do not have space for this.Ultimately its your choice do dishes the manual way or the Bosch way.
2082,2016-07-05,4,Performance of the machine is good.. Service is not that great,"Performance of the Machine is really good... RPM and temperature can be adjusted...

2090,2019-11-21,1,Worst machine worst sales after service don‚Äôt buy,Within one month machine has stopped functioning and with repeated calls none has turned up for past one month....worst service
2091,2018-10-14,1,Go for other brands with good after sales service,"Machine inlet valve is out of job ! It‚Äôs not stopping the water supply, water keep on running and after complaining one service engineer came and said part is not available. And gone , after follow up complain no one came , After sales service is so pathetic."
2092,2015-11-24,4,I am very happy with this machine,I am very happy with this machine. I always used top-loading machine before. I have noticed that it is also quite energy efficient. It washes the clothes very well. I just wish that it was more silent.
2093,2016-07-08,5,Best one ever....,Bosch this is an one of the best one in the market.1.power savings2. Water savings3. perfecte wash4.no sound makes
2094,2017-04-27,5,The best,Perfect & the best. This is the machine which I was looking for. Perfect wash & it's sound less.
2095,2017-10-18,1,Machine not working although used sparingly.,"I sparingly use the machine which is one year old but when my maid is absent for 15 days, I am using it alternate days and after 7 washes, it has stopped washing. Bosch customer care executive said every month I am supposed to call a plumber and clean the filter from where water is entering. The technician who had installed it didn't inform this."
2096,2017-03-20,5,Just awesome Khareed lo,"This is my first front loader. I've used it for a while and I can tell you this is awesome! It is super silent and the vibrations are very minimal if not hard to notice. It has all the washing modes a front loader can have. In case you are curious, the Monsoon mode is used for washing rain soaked clothes that smell. I particularly liked the Drum Clean mode. It makes it a bit easier to maintain the machine. The size is just right. The grey color looks great! The quality of the machine is superb!It's a good idea to buy a trolley. This will allow you to move the machine whenever necessary. It will also protect it from water leakages caused by external sources within the house. If you have voltage problems, it's a must to install a stabilizer or spike guard. Installing a water filter is important as some particles may enter the machine making it difficult to maintain it. Always use a tap connection that has a water pressure up to 8 liters per minute. The rubber seal on the entrance needs to be wiped clean to prevent mold formations. If necessary, use white vinegar to clean the seal as it is helpful in removing odor and mold formations. Keep the door open for a few hours once the washing is done. This allows the moisture to dry within the drum. Finally, follow your manufacturer's instructions on the machine's usage and maintenance. This will lengthen the life of your machine.After a lot of research, I've found that in general, the technology used in all front loaders including Bosch isn't perfect. In fact, several cases are pending against front load machine manufacturers in the U.S. for continuing to use this imperfect technology as this has not made consumer's life easier. Now you might wonder what this is all about! It's all about maintenance! There are many issues that are caused by manufacturing defects. These front loaders get mold formation easily plus some people have even reported drum issues like rusting! Improper maintenance on the part of the owners will also lead to these issues. Beware that the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) can be damaged by rough or improper handling of the machine's controls (Buttons & Dial). Power spikes and low voltages in India are the biggest reasons why majority of the owners are affected by burnt PCBs. Replacing the PCB is very expensive (Costs Rs. 10,000 in India!). This is seriously high maintenance! The deal breaker is that it is cheaper to buy a new machine instead of repairing the existing machine (in case of a drum issue)! What I am trying to say is that you must be very careful on the maintenance aspect. Check for any defects in your machine in order to avoid any maintenance headaches in the future. I am aware of the issues plaguing the front loaders and so should you. Remember irrespective of all these issues, front loaders clean the best and are easy to use.If you are looking for an excellent front loader, Bosch is the one for you!Additional Information:- The 6 kg Bosch models are imports (at the time of this writing this review). As a result they incur high maintenance costs (especially PCBs). The good news is that the 7 kg Bosch models are made in India! I'm surmising that the PCB cost and other costs of these machines may be low due to localization!FEW MONTHS USE UPDATE=======================I want to point out one issue with Bosch machines. If you carefully notice, they've carefully avoided using the words Stainless Steel Drum and instead use the word VarioDrums in their description of the drum. That means they are acknowledging that stainless steel drum isn't used in this machine or any of its other washer models. Like everyone, I too thought that Bosch had a stainless steel drum. I'm now really disappointed that Bosch has made this an issue! When brands like IFB though unreliable, had stainless steel drums, what is Bosch thinking! The drum is made of smooth iron with chromium coating that resists corrosion and ensures that the wash quality is excellent. But the coating is prone to wear with the passage of time or if some unauthorized descale powder is used! You will be able to use the washing machine even after the wear but the wash quality will be affected a bit and only God knows when rusting may strike! This means at some point we've to replace the drum with another coated iron drum which costs Rs. 9,000 in addition to labour charges! Smells like Bosch is trying to make money using this issue! That's really low of Bosch! They have put up an excellent machine but they are damaging their reputation with such cheap money grubbing methods.And in case all I've said made you confused, please remember that my issue was only with the drum. I've made a mistake of using a top load descale powder on this machine and in one go the entire coating was gone! I've attached a picture for your reference. It wouldn't have been an issue if it was made of stainless steel. So if you avoid mistakes like this and use the machine properly the coating will last a long time before it warrants a replacement.I've no issues with even paying a little more to get a stainless steel drum machine. Bosch should've at least put up stainless steel drum models or variants offering the customers more choices. To date this machine is fantastic, reliable and super silent with the only flaw being the type of drum used in it! I would still recommend Bosch because overall it is still a brilliant machine!"
2097,2019-04-11,1,Worst Product,Worst product i have ever used simply BOSCH is nothing for a indian customer.. always germans thinking they are only great..
2098,2017-08-08,4,Four Stars,Very gud product
2099,2017-08-29,5,"best washing machine, period!","I have used Samsung and Whirlpool washing machines before this one. Only reason going for Bosch was the expectation that it will not give me any trouble. And it has lived up to it. It has been nearly two years, and I have not faced any problem whatsoever till date. and now I only recommend Bosch to my friends.Reasons:1. build Quality. It is pure metal body but rust resistant. So no issues with sturdiness as you would find in plastic bodies, nor does it rust like other metal bodies2. Even though LG makes a big issue of it being free of vibrations, this machine is quitter and completely vibration free. Also it is so quiet, that we don't notice its running in the drawing room, even though it is placed in adjacent balcony and the door is open. Only when it beeps to indicate that washing is done. do we realize that it was running all this while.3. less electricity consumption. Though I don't have exact figures for this WM alone, it does seem to consume less electricity4. less water consumption. this is something I have personally checked and verified that it consumes very less water for full load5. fast mode: If you have to wash just one or two pieces of garments urgently, this does the job real quick. The washing is immaculate and drying is so good that I directly ironed my shirt and in little over half an hour, I was actually wearing the shirt! really loved that!So I will say it is real value for money, if you add up costs of maintenance of other WMs to their price. Not to mention the piece of mind as well."

2117,2018-01-16,1,One Star,"BOSCH WASHING product is not good,out body iorn not steel"
2118,2017-04-25,5,I just Love it !!!,"I have brought the same  washing machine (6.5 kg 1000 rpm) and I have been using from past 5 months.The way it looks is more beautiful than this pic which it shows and has a beautiful silver color with black contrast which looks so good. Coming to the working part the person who came to install has provided me few options like extended warranty if some amount is paid I said no.And he has showed me Bosch drum cleaning powder and cover exclusively of BOSCH.I just loved these both and the cover costed me 1000 rupees and I don't remember the cost of drum cleaning powder but monthly once I use it and just looks so neat after every month after doing so. He also said that a filter for the pipe could help the machines long run  which does not allow any dust particles to go inside since here in my home I know that the water will not be so clean for my new washing machine I just opted it now I feel that I have done a good thing by taking it bcz I can see now the filter has become bit dirty for 4 months and the filter is really helping me. Coming to wash cycles you can even clean chiffon and other lite fabrics too.Suppose you think to save time then what you can do is soak the clothes with detergent 1 hr before and just place this clothes directly without squeezing any water and select Spin/Drain option wow this one I just like  this will be completed in less than 10 min. Vario  drum is one where you can be bit relaxed when you think what shall happen to my clothes in this machine.It has droplets of design through out the drum which leaves your clothes so soft and with now harsh contact to the drum at any given point of time.And RPM selection you can change the rpm from (1000 rpm  to 400 rpm if I am not wrong) so that you go for blankest select highest rpm ( my case 1000 rpm) and for turkey towels, saris, light wight dresses  go to less rpm this option  is very good.Also  make a habit to keeping the door ajar for 10 min once the washing is done for the day also keep cloth for washing machine to clean the drum after end of every use.This helps your drum to stay clean and fresh.Monthly once open the detergent dispenser tray and clean with cloth gently bcz this will lead to smell your drum after few days if left unattended and below outlet which you find towards the right side corner if anything obstructs during the wash will be found here I just found a safety pin once on doing so .So always keep an eye on this two things.Best option after using the programs i can say is use Cold option with no temperature so that you need not worry about the shine of your clothes later.Use speed perfect option only when it is really required for an effective life of the washing machine.When Initially when you operate your washing machine it is recommended to wash with no clothes and select drum clean option and add some drum clean powder and then start keep adding your clothes for wash.I just really liked it though the product BOSCH is bit costlier when it comes to price and maintenance  but you can enjoy it at the same time."

Got peace of mind from maid too. :)Utensils are coming out neat & clean like never before. It doesn't come with a stand so have to put something below it (like granite slab or something) to lift it up a bit. Have to bend down every time to do work.Uses less water and gives neat, clean & odorless utensils. Never left out with any food, dirt or stickiness.Control panel is good with tons of functions, enough space for small & big utensils. 2 hot water blower-fans are given. Works silently. It's a 1.4KWatt machine so power consumption seems high. But it does more than what it consumes.PROS1. Gives neat & clean, odorless utensils.2. Never left out with any food, dirt or stickiness.3.
